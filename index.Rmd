#### Course Description {-}

This course is intended for those with little or no past training in
quantitative methods. The course is an intensive introduction to some of
the principles and methods of statistical analysis in social research.
Topics covered in MY464 include descriptive statistics, basic ideas of
inference and estimation, contingency tables and an introduction to
linear regression models. For those with some quantitative training the
slightly more advanced course MY452 (Applied Regression Analysis) would
be more appropriate, followed by other Department of Methodology and
Department of Statistics courses on quantitative methods, such as MY454
(Applied Statistical Computing), MY455 (Multivariate Analysis and
Measurement), MY456 (Survey Methodology), MY457 (Causal Inference for
Observational and Experimental Studies), MY459 (Quantitative Text
Analysis), ST416 (Multilevel Modelling), and ST442 (Longitudinal Data
Analysis).

#### Course Objectives {-}

This course aims to impart a level of familiarity suitable for a
moderately critical understanding of the statistical material in the
journals commonly used by students in their work and the ability to use
some elementary techniques.

\newpage

#### Teaching {-}

-   **Lectures**: Video recorded lectures released each Monday morning in weeks 1 - 5 and 7 - 11

-   **Applied exercises**: Each week there will be an exercise for students to complete 
    in which the ideas covered in the lecture for that week will be applied to a real
    data set using the software package R/RStudio. Each exercise will have an accompanying
    explanatory video and a multiple-choice quiz to be completed on Moodle to check
    your learning. 

-   **Seminars**: Students will attend a one-hour seminar each
    week, **starting in Week 2**. The seminars will go over the material covered
    in that week's lecture, the corresponding applied exercise and provide a forum
    for students to ask questions and discuss the material covered in the course. 
    Seminars will be available to attend in person and online. 
    Please consult the on-line timetables for the times and locations of the class groups. 
    The allocation of students to seminars is done through LSE for You. 
    This will be explained in the first lecture and on the Moodle page. 
    Please contact the course administrator listed on the Moodle
    page if you have any issues.

#### Course Materials {-}

-   **Coursepack**: This coursepack is the main course text.  It is available
    to be viewed online at https://lse-methodology.github.io/MY464/  You can
    view the coursepack in HTML form, or download it as a PDF or ePub to view
    offline.

-   **Lecture slides**: Copies of the slides displayed during
    the lectures can be downloaded from the MY464 Moodle page.

-   **Recommended course texts**:

    -   Alan Agresti and Christine Franklin (2013). *Statistics: The Art
        and Science of Learning from Data* (Third Ed.). Pearson.

    -   Alan Agresti and Barbara Finlay (2013). *Statistical Methods for
        the Social Sciences* (Fourth Ed.). Pearson

    Earlier/later editions are also suitable. While neither of these books is
    absolutely required, you may wish to purchase one if you would
    like to have additional explanation, examples and exercises to
    supplement the coursepack.  Of these two, Agresti and Finlay is a
    bit more advanced. It is also the recommended additional course text
    for MY452 (which also has a coursepack similar to this one), so you
    may want to purchase it if you are planning to also take
    that course.

-   **Other text books**: There are hundreds of introductory textbooks
    on statistics and quantitative methods, many of them covering almost
    identical material. If you have one which you would like to use, and
    which looks as if it covers the same material at about the same
    level as this course, then it is probably suitable as
    additional reading.

    -   There are also many books and online resources which focus on 
        the R/RStudio software package used in the computer classes. 
        We do not consider them necessary for this course, or for learning
        statistics. 


#### MY464 on Moodle {-}
<!-- {#sss-moodle} -->

The course materials are all available on Moodle. Go to
<http://moodle.lse.ac.uk/> and login using your *username* and
*password* (the same as for your LSE e-mail). Then in the *select
courses* dialogue box type in MY464, and in *search results* click on
MY464. The site contains the structure of the course week by week, the
readings, weekly applied exercises and the associated data
sets, coursepack and other materials, as well as a section on news and
announcements.

#### Notes on studying for the course {-}

To learn the material from this course you must do the work every week
since it is cumulative; if you miss a week or two
there is a chance that you will struggle to catch up. Also bear in mind that
most people cannot learn quantitative techniques passively by just
watching the lectures and reading the occasional chapter in a
textbook. To learn statistics you have to do it; there are no shortcuts.
Thus in addition to a  lecture there will be a weekly applied exercise
(in which you do some data analysis and interpretation
using R/RStudio - instructions will be provided).
Doing the exercises and discussing them in the weekly class
is the best way to make sure you have understood and can apply what was covered
in the lectures. If you are having any trouble this will reveal what the
problem is. Thus the course is designed to have multiple, reinforcing
ways of helping you learn this material.

#### Examinations/assessment {-}

There will be a **two-hour examination in January in the LENT Term**. 
The exam will be completed online during a three hour window. 
Examination papers from previous years are available for
revision purposes at the LSE library web site.  2018-19 was the first year that
MY464 has existed, but the past exams for MY451 provide a good guide to the kinds of
questions that we ask.  Exams vary from year to year.  Some questions closely follow
questions that you will have answered in the homeworks or have seen on past exam papers.
Other require you to apply the principles you have learned in new ways. Students should
understand that past examinations should only be used as rough guides to
the types of questions that are likely to appear on the examination.

#### Computing {-}

Students must know their Username and Password in time for the first
applied exercise in week 1. This information can be obtained from IT Help Desk (Library, 1st
floor). The software package used for MY464 is R/RStudio, which will be introduced in the first
applied exercise in week 1.

#### Software availability {-}

R/RStudio is free to download and does not require a licence.

#### Feedback {-}

We welcome any comments you have on the course. If there are any
problems that we can deal with, we will attempt to do so as quickly as
possible. Speak to any member of the course team, or to your
departmental supervisor if you feel that would be easier for you. Also
please let us know if you find any errors or omissions in the
coursepack, so that we can correct them.

#### FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions {-}

**Why do we use R/RStudio? I’ve heard that SAS/STATA/MINITAB/SPSS/LIMDEP is
better.** At this level it does not matter which program you use since
we are learning standard procedures that are common to all programs. In
favour of R/RStudio is that it is free, flexible and extremely powerful.

**Can I get a copy of the R/RStudio software to use on my home computer?**
Yes, this will be explained in weeks 1 and 2 applied exercises and classes.

**I’m taking MY464 because I want to learn how to use R/RStudio but we don’t
seem to learn very much about the program. Why is that?** MY464 is not a
course about learning to use R/RStudio. We use the program merely to
facilitate data analysis and interpretation. Some options for learning
more about R/RStudio will be mentioned in the first lecture.

**I’m taking MY464 to help me analyse data for my dissertation. Can I
discuss my data and my specific problems with the lecturers?** Yes, but
not during the course. Staff of the Department of Methodology will be
happy to talk to you about problems specific to your dissertation during
the weekly sessions of the Methodology Surgery (see the website of the
department for more information).

**Does the coursepack contain everything I need to know for the exam?**
Yes. However, you will stand by far the best chance in the exam if you
also attend the lectures, where the lecturers emphasise and explain the
key parts of the material.

**The lecturer introduced some material that was not in the coursepack.
Do I need to know that material?** This is almost certainly an illusion.
The lectures will not introduce any genuinely new material not included
in the course pack. However, sometimes the lecturer may of course use
different words or a different example to further explain some topic.
Copies of the most relevant notes displayed at the lectures will be
posted in the MY464 Moodle site. All of the material required for the
exam is contained in the coursepack, with the posted lecture notes as
additional clarification.

**Can I work together on the applied exercises with my friends?** Yes, we
positively encourage you to discuss the exercises with your
colleagues. If you do this, please make sure you complete the multiple-choice
quiz yourself.

**I’m not registered at the LSE but at another University of London
college. Can I attend this course?** Normally yes, but you will have to
complete an intercollegiate enrolment form.

**I would like to audit the course without taking the exam. Is that
OK?** Yes, you are welcome to attend the lectures providing you are an
LSE/University of London student and there is room for you.

**MY464 is not challenging enough for me. Is there a more difficult
course?** Yes, MY452 and numerous other courses offered by the
Department of Methodology and the Statistics department.
