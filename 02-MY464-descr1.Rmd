# Descriptive statistics {#c-descr1}

## Introduction {#s-descr1-intro}

This chapter introduces some common descriptive statistical methods. It
is organised around two dichotomies:

-   Methods that are used only for variables with small numbers of
    values, vs. methods that are used also or only for variables with
    many values (see the end of Section \@ref(ss-intro-def-vartypes) for more on
    this distinction). The former include, in particular, descriptive
    methods for categorical variables, and the latter the methods for
    continuous variables.

-   **Univariate** descriptive methods which consider only one variable
    at a time, vs. **bivariate** methods which aim to describe the
    association between *two* variables.

Section \@ref(s-descr1-1cat) describes univariate methods for categorical
variables and Section \@ref(s-descr1-2cat) bivariate methods for cases
where both variables are categorical. Sections \@ref(s-descr1-1cont) and
\@ref(s-descr1-nums) cover univariate methods which are mostly used for
continuous variables. Section \@ref(s-descr1-2cont) lists some bivariate
methods where at least one variable is continuous; these methods are
discussed in detail elsewhere in the coursepack. The chapter concludes
with some general guidelines for presentation of descriptive tables and
graphs in Section \@ref(s-descr1-presentation).

## Example data sets {#s-descr1-examples}

Two examples are used to illustrate the methods throughout this chapter:

*Example: Country data* \label{country_example}

Consider data for 155 countries on three variables:

-   The **region** where the country is located, coded as 1=Africa,
    2=Asia, 3=Europe, 4=Latin America, 5=Northern America, 6=Oceania.

-   A measure of the level of **democracy** in the country, measured on
    an 11-point scale from 0 (lowest level of democracy) to
    10 (highest).

-   Gross Domestic Product (**GDP**) per capita, in thousands
    of U.S. dollars.

Further information on the variables is given in the appendix to this
chapter (Section \@ref(s-descr1-app)), together with the whole data set,
shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-countrydata).

Region is clearly a discrete (and categorical), nominal-level variable,
and GDP a continuous, interval-level variable. The democracy index is
discrete; it is most realistic to consider its measurement level to be
ordinal, and it is regarded as such in this chapter. However, it is the
kind of variable which might in many analyses be treated instead as an
effectively continuous, interval-level variable.

*Example: Survey data on attitudes towards income redistribution*


The data for the second example come from Round 5 of the European Social
Survey (ESS), which was carried out in 2010.^[ESS Round 5: European Social Survey Round 5 Data (2010). Data file
edition 2.0. Norwegian Social Science Data Services, Norway - Data
Archive and distributor of ESS data.] The survey was fielded
in 28 countries, but here we use only data from 2344 respondents in the
UK. Two variables are considered:

-   **Sex** of the respondent, coded as 1=Male, 2=Female.

-   Answer to the following survey question:\
    *“The government should take measures to reduce differences in
    income levels”*,\
    with five response options coded as “Agree strongly”=1, “Agree”=2,
    “Neither agree nor disagree”=3, “Disagree”=4, and “Disagree
    strongly”=5. This is a measure of the respondent’s **attitude**
    towards income redistribution.

Both of these are discrete, categorical variables. Sex is binary and
attitude is ordinal.

Attitudes towards *income redistribution* are an example of the broader
topic of public opinion on welfare state policies. This is a large topic
of classic and current interest in the social sciences, and questions on
it have been included in many public opinion surveys.^[For recent findings, see for example Svallfors, S. (ed.) (2012),
*Contested Welfare States: Welfare Attitudes in Europe and Beyond*.
Stanford University Press.] Of key
interest is to explore the how people’s attitudes are associated with
their individual characteristics (including such factors as age, sex,
education and income) and the contexts in which they live (for example
the type of welfare regime adopted in their country). In section
\@ref(s-descr1-2cat) below we use descriptive statistics to examine such
associations between sex and attitude in this sample.

## Single categorical variable {#s-descr1-1cat}

### Describing the sample distribution {#ss-descr1-1cat-distr}

The term *distribution* is very important in statistics. In this section
we consider the distribution of a single variable in the observed data,
i.e. its *sample distribution*:

-   The **sample distribution** of a variable consists of a list of the
    values of the variable which occur in a sample, together with the
    number of times each value occurs.

Later we will discuss other kinds of distributions, such as population,
probability and sampling distributions, but they will all be variants of
the same concept.

The task of descriptive statistics for a single variable is to summarize
the sample distribution or some features of it. This can be done in the
form of tables, graphs or single numbers.

### Tabular methods: Tables of frequencies {#ss-descr1-1cat-tables}

When a variable has only a limited number of distinct values, its sample
distribution can be summarized directly from the definition given above.
In other words, we simply count and display the number of times each of
the values appears in the data. One way to do the display is as a table,
like the ones for region and the democracy index in the country data,
and attitude in the survey example, which are shown in Tables
\@ref(tab:t-region), \@ref(tab:t-democ) and \@ref(tab:t-attitude) respectively.

  : (\#tab:t-attitude)Frequency distribution of responses to a question on attitude
  towards income redistribution in the survey example.

Each row of such a table corresponds to one possible value of a
variable, and the second column shows the number of units with that
value in the data. Thus there are 48 countries from Africa and 44 from
Asia in the contry data set and 32 countries with the highest democracy
score 10, and so on. Similarly, 366 respondents in the survey sample
strongly agreed with the attitude question, and 75 strongly disagreed
with it. These counts are also called **frequencies**, a distribution
like this is a **frequency distribution**, and the table is also known
as a **frequency table**. The sum of the frequencies, given on the line
labelled “Total” in the tables, is the sample size $n$, here 155 for the
country data and 2344 for the survey data.

It is sometimes more convenient to consider relative values of the
frequencies instead of the frequencies themselves. The **relative
frequency** or **proportion** of a category of a variable is its
frequency divided by the sample size. For example, the proportion of
countries from Africa in the country data is $48/155=0.310$ (rounded to
three decimal places). A close relative of the proportion is the
**percentage**, which is simply proportion multiplied by a hundred; for
example, 31% of the countries in the sample are from Africa. The sum of
the proportions is one, and the sum of the percentages is one hundred
(because of rounding error, the sum in a reported table may be very
slightly different, as it is in Table \@ref(tab:t-democ)).

### Graphical methods: Bar charts {#ss-descr1-1cat-charts}

Graphical methods of describing data (*statistical graphics*) make use
of our ability to process and interpret even very large amounts of
visual information. The basic graph for summarising the sample
distribution of a discrete variable is a **bar chart**. It is the
graphical equivalent of a one-way table of frequencies.

Figures \@ref(fig:f-bars-region), \@ref(fig:f-bars-democ) and
\@ref(fig:f-bars-attitude) show the bar charts for region, democracy index
and attitude, corresponding to the frequencies in Tables \@ref(tab:t-region),
\@ref(tab:t-democ) and \@ref(tab:t-attitude). Each bar corresponds to one category
of the variable, and the height of the bar is proportional to the
frequency of observations in that category. This visual cue allows us to
make quick comparisons between the frequencies of different categories
by comparing the heights of the bars.

![(\#fig:f-bars-region)Bar chart of regions in the country data.](regions){height="9.5cm"}

![(\#fig:f-bars-democ)Bar chart of the democracy index in the country data.](democ){height="9.5cm"}

![(\#fig:f-bars-attitude)Bar chart of the attitude variable in the survey data example. Agreement with statement: ``The government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels''. European Social Survey, Round 5 (2010), UK respondents only.](bar_attitude){height="8cm"}

Some guidelines for drawing bar charts are:

-   The heights of the bars may represent frequencies, proportions
    or percentages. This only changes the units on the vertical axis but
    not the relative heights of the bars. The shape of the graph will be
    the same in each case. In Figure \@ref(fig:f-bars-region), the units are
    frequencies, while in Figures \@ref(fig:f-bars-democ) and
    \@ref(fig:f-bars-attitude) they are percentages.

-   The bars do not touch each other, to highlight the discrete nature
    of the variable.

-   The bars *must* start at zero. It they do not, visual comparisons
    between their heights are distorted and the graph becomes useless.

-   If the variable is ordinal, the bars must be in the natural order of
    the categories, as in Figures \@ref(fig:f-bars-democ) and
    \@ref(fig:f-bars-attitude). If the variable is nominal, the order
    is arbitrary. Often it makes sense to order the categories from
    largest (i.e. the one with the largest frequency) to the smallest,
    possibly leaving any “Others” category last. In Figure
    \@ref(fig:f-bars-region), the frequency ordering would swap Northern
    America and Oceania, but it seems more natural to keep Northern and
    Latin America next to each other.

A bar chart is a relatively unexciting statistical graphic in that it
does not convey very much visual information. For nominal variables, in
particular, the corresponding table is often just as easy to understand
and takes less space. For ordinal variables, the bar chart has the
additional advantage that its shape shows how the frequencies vary
across the ordering of the categories. For example, Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bars-democ) quite effectively conveys the information that the
most common values of the democracy index are the extreme scores 0 and
10.

Sometimes you may see graphs which look like bar charts of this kind,
but which actually show the values of a single variable for some units
rather than frequncies or percentages. For example, a report on the
economies of East Asia might show a chart of GDP per capita for Japan,
China, South Korea and North Korea, with one bar for each country, and
their heights proportional to 28.2, 5.0, 17.8 and 1.3 respectively
(c.f. the data in Table \@ref(tab:t-countrydata)). The basic idea of such
graphs is the same as that of standard bar charts. However, they are not
particularly useful as descriptive statistics, since they simply display
values in the original data without any summarization or simplification.

### Simple descriptive statistics {#ss-descr1-1cat-descriptives}

Instead of the whole sample distribution, we may want to summarise only
some individual aspects of it, such as its central tendency or
variation. Descriptive statistics that are used for this purpose are
broadly similar for both discrete and continuous variables, so they will
be discussed together for both in Section \@ref(s-descr1-nums).

## Two categorical variables {#s-descr1-2cat}

### Two-way contingency tables {#ss-descr1-2cat-tables}

The next task we consider is how to describe the sample distributions of
two categorical variables together, and in so doing also summarise the
association between these variables. The key tool is a table which shows
the **crosstabulation** of the frequencies of the variables. This is
also known as a **contingency table**. Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) shows
such a table for the respondents’ sex and attitude in our survey
example. We use it to introduce the basic structure and terminology of
contingency tables:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \             Agree         \     Neither agree      \       Disagree        \
  Sex          strongly     Agree   nor disagree    Disagree   strongly    Total
  -------- --------------- ------- --------------- ---------- ---------- -------
  Male           160         439         187          200         41        1027

  Female         206         651         239          187         34        1317

  Total          366        1090         426          387         75        2344
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : (\#tab:t-sex-attitude)*``The government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels''*: Two-way table of frequencies of respondents in the survey example,
  by sex and attitude towards income redistribution. Data: European Social Survey, Round 5, 2010, UK respondents only.

-   Because a table like \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) summarizes the values of
    two variables, it is known as a **two-way** contingency table.
    Similarly, the tables of single variables introduced in Section
    \@ref(ss-descr1-1cat-tables) are *one-way* tables. It is also
    possible to construct tables involving more than two variables,
    i.e. three-way tables, four-way tables, and so on. These are
    discussed in Chapter \@ref(c-3waytables).

-   The variables in a contingency table may ordinal or nominal
    (including dichotomous). Often an ordinal variable is derived by
    grouping an originally continuous, interval-level variable, a
    practice which is discussed further in Section \@ref(s-descr1-1cont).

-   The horizontal divisions of a table (e.g. the lines corresponding to
    the two sexes in Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude)) are its **rows**, and
    the vertical divisions (e.g. the survey responses in Table
    \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude)) are its **columns**.

-   The size of a contingency table is stated in terms of the numbers of
    its rows and columns. For example, Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) is a
    $2\times
    5$ (pronounced “two-by-five”) table, because it has two rows and
    five columns. This notation may also be used symbolically, so that
    we may refer generically to $R\times C$ tables which have
    some (unspecified) number of $R$ rows and $C$ columns. The smallest
    two-way table is thus a $2\times 2$ table, where both variables
    are dichotomous.

-   The intersection of a row and a column is a **cell** of the table.
    The basic two-way contingency table shows in each cell the
    number (frequency) of units in the data set with the corresponding
    values of the row variable and the column variable. For example,
    Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) shows that there were 160 male
    respondents who strongly agreed with the statement, and 239 female
    respondents who neither agreed nor disagreed with it. These
    frequencies are also known as **cell counts**.

-   The row and column labelled “Total” in Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude)
    are known as the **margins** of the table. They show the frequencies
    of the values of the row and the column variable separately, summing
    the frequencies over the categories of the other variable. For
    example, the table shows that there were overall 1027
    ($=160+439+187+200+41$) male respondents, and that overall 75
    ($=41+34$) respondents strongly disagreed with the statement. In
    other words, the margins are *one-way* tables of the frequencies of
    each of the two variables, so for example the frequencies on the
    margin for attitude in Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) are the same as
    the ones in the one-way table for this variable shown in Table
    \@ref(tab:t-attitude). The distributions described by the margins are
    known as the **marginal distributions** of the row and
    column variables. In contrast, the frequencies in the internal cells
    of the table, which show how many units have each possible
    *combination* of the row and column variables, describe the **joint
    distribution** of the two variables.

-   The number in the bottom right-hand corner of the table is the sum
    of all of the frequencies, i.e. the total sample size $n$.

In addition to frequencies, it is often convenient to display
proportions or percentages. Dividing the frequencies by the sample size
gives overall proportions and (multiplying by a hundred) percentages.
This is illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-pr), which shows the
overall proportions, obtained by dividing the frequencies in Table
\@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) by $n=2344$. For example, out of all these
respondents, the proportion of 0.102 ($=239/2344$) were women who
neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement. The proportions are
also shown for the marginal distributions: for example, 15.6% (i.e. the
proportion $0.156=366/2344$) of the respondents strongly agreed with the
statement. The sum of the proportions over all the cells is 1, as shown
in the bottom right corner of the table.

  example, with each combination of sex and attitude towards income
  redistribution. Data: European Social Survey, Round 5, 2010, UK respondents only.

### Conditional proportions {#ss-descr1-2cat-cond}

A two-way contingency table is symmetric in that it does not distinguish
between explanatory and response variables. In many applications,
however, this distinction is useful for interpretation. In our example,
for instance, it is natural to treat sex as the explanatory variable and
attitude towards income redistribution as the response response, and so
to focus the interpretation on how attitude may depend on sex.

The overall proportions are in such cases not the most relevant
quantities for interpretation of a table. Instead, we typically
calculate proportions within each category of the row variable or the
column variable, i.e. the **conditional proportions** of one variable
given the other. The numbers in brackets in Table
\@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-row) show these proportions calculated for each
*row* of Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude) (Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-row) also
includes the actual frequencies; it is advisable to include them even
when conditional proportions are of most interest, to show the numbers
on which the proportions are based). In other words, these are the
conditional proportions of attitude towards income redistribution given
sex, i.e. separately for men and women. For example, the number 0.156 in
the top left-hand corner of Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-row) is obtained
by dividing the number of male respondents who agreed strongly with the
statement (160) by the total number of male respondents (1027). Thus
15.6% of the men strongly agreed, and for example 2.6% of women strongly
disagreed with the statement. The (1.0) in the last column of the table
indicate that the proportions sum to 1 along each row, to remind us that
the conditional proportions have been calculated within the rows. The
bracketed proportions in the ‘Total’ row are the proportions of the
*marginal* distribution of the attitude variable, so they are the same
as the proportions in the ‘Total’ row of Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-pr).

  : (\#tab:t-sex-attitude-row)*``The government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels''*: Two-way table of frequencies of respondents in the survey example,
  by sex and attitude towards income redistribution. The numbers in
  brackets are proportions within the rows, i.e. conditional proportions
  of attitude given sex. Data: European Social Survey, Round 5, 2010, UK respondents only.

We could also have calculated conditional proportions within the
*columns*, i.e. for sex given attitude. For example, the proportion
$0.563=206/366$ of all respondents who strongly agreed with the
statement are women. These, however, seem less interesting, because it
seems more natural to examine how attitude varies by sex rather than how
sex varies by attitude. In general, for any two-way table we can
calculate conditional proportions for both the rows and the columns, but
typically only one of them is used for interpretation.

### Conditional distributions and associations {#ss-descr1-2cat-assoc}

Suppose that we regard one variable in a two-way table as the
explanatory variable (let us denote it by $X$) and the other variable as
the response variable ($Y$). In our survey example, sex is thus $X$ and
attitude is $Y$. Here the dichotomous $X$ divides the full sample into
two groups, identified by the observed value of $X$ — men and women. We
may then think of these two groups as two separate samples, and consider
statistical quantities separately for each of them. In particular, in
Table \@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-row) we calculated conditional proportions for
$Y$ given $X$, i.e. for attitude given sex. These proportions describe
two distinct sample distributions of $Y$, one for men and one for women.
They are examples of *conditional distributions*:

-   The **conditional distribution** of a variable $Y$ given another
    variable $X$ is the distribution of $Y$ among those units which have
    a particular value of $X$.

This concept is not limited to two-way tables but extends also to other
kinds of variables and distributions that are discussed later in this
coursepack. Both the response variable $Y$ and the explanatory variable
$X$ may be continuous as well as discrete, and can have any number of
values. In all such cases there is a separate conditional distribution
for $Y$ for each possible value of $X$. A particular one of these
distributions is sometimes referred to more explicitly as the
conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$, where the “$X=x$” indicates
that $X$ is considered at a particular value $x$ (as in “the
distribution of $Y$ given $X=2$”, say).

Conditional distributions of one variable given another allow us to
define and describe associations between the variables. The informal
definition in Section \@ref(ss-intro-def-assoc) stated that there is an
association between two variables if knowing the value of one of them
will help to predict the value of the other. We can now give a more
precise definition:

-   There is an **association** between variables $X$ and $Y$ if the
    conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is different for different
    values of $X$.

This definition coincides with the more informal one. If the conditional
distribution of $Y$ varies with $X$ and if we know $X$, it is best to
predict $Y$ from its conditional distribution given the known value of
$X$. This will indeed work better than predicting $Y$ without using
information on $X$, i.e. from the marginal distribution of $Y$.
Prediction based on the conditional distribution would still be subject
to error, because in most cases $X$ does not predict $Y$ perfectly. In
other words, the definition of an association considered here is
*statistical* (or *probabilistic*) rather than *deterministic*. In our
example a deterministic association would mean that there is one
response given by all the men and one response (possibly different from
the men’s) given by all the women. This is of course not the case here
nor in most other applications in the social sciences. It is thus
crucially important that we have the tools also to analyse statistical
associations.

In our example, sex and attitude are associated if men and women differ
in their attitudes toward income redistribution. Previous studies
suggest that such an association exists, and that it takes the form that
women tend to have higher levels of support than men for
redistribution.^[See, for example, Svallfors (1997), Words of welfare and attitudes
to redistribution: A comparison of eight western nations, *European
Sociological Review*, 13, 283-304; and Blekesaune and Quadagno
(2003), Public attitudes towards welfare state policies: A
comparative analysis of 24 nations, *European Sociological Review*,
19, 415-427.] As possible explanations for this pattern, both
structural reasons (women tend to have lower incomes than men and to
rely more on welfare state support) and cultural or psychological ones
(women are more likely than men to adopt social values of equality and
caring) have been suggested.

### Describing an association using conditional proportions {#ss-descr1-2cat-descr}

Two variables presented in a contingency table are associated in the
sample if the conditional distributions of one of them vary across the
values of the other. This is the case in our data set: for example, 4.0%
of men but 2.6% of women strongly disagree with the statement. There is
thus some association between sex and attitude in this sample. This much
is easy to conclude. What requires a little more work is a more detailed
description of the pattern and strength of the association, i.e. how and
where the conditional distributions differ from each other.

The most general way of summarising associations in a contingency table
is by comparing the conditional proportions of the same level of the
response given different levels of the explanatory variable. There is no
simple formula for how this should be done, so you should use your
common sense to present comparisons which give a good summary of the
patterns across the table. Unless both variables in the table are
dichotomous, several different comparisons may be needed, and may not
all display similar patterns. For example, in Table
\@ref(tab:t-sex-attitude-row) the same proportion (0.156, or 15.6%) of both
men and women strongly agree with the statement, whereas the proportion
who respond “Agree” is higher for women (49.4%) than for men (42.8%).

When the response variable is ordinal, it is often more illuminating to
focus on comparisons of *cumulative* proportions which add up
conditional proportions over two or more adjacent categories. For
instance, the combined proportion of respondents who either strongly
agree or agree with the statement is a useful summary of the general
level of agreement among the respondents. In our example this is 58.4%
($=15.5\%+42.8\%$) for men but 65.0% for women.

A comparison between two proportions may be further distilled into a
single number by reporting the *difference* or *ratio* between them. For
example, for the proportions of agreeing or strongly agreeing above, the
difference is $0.650-0.584=0.066$, so the proportion is 0.066 (i.e. 6.6
percentage points) higher for women than for men. The ratio of these
proportions is $0.650/0.584=1.11$, so the proportion for women is 1.11
times the proportion for men (i.e. 11% higher). Both of these indicate
that in this sample women were more likely to agree or strongly agree
with the statement than were men. In a particular application we might
report a difference or a ratio like this, depending on which of them was
considered more relevant or easily understandable. Other summaries are
also possible; for example, on MY452 we will discuss a measure called
the *odds ratio*, which turns out to be convenient for more general
methods of analysing associations involving categorical variables.

The broad conclusion in the example is that there is an association
between sex and attitude in these data from the European Social Survey,
and that it is of the kind suggested by existing literature. A larger
proportion of women than of men indicate agreement with the statement
that the government should take measures to reduce income differences,
and conversely larger proportion of men disagree with it (e.g. 23.5% of
men but only 16.8% of women disagree or strongly disagree). Thus in this
sample women do indeed demonstrate somewhat higher levels of support for
income redistribution. Whether these differences also warrant a
generalisation of the conclusions to people outside the sample is a
question which we will take up in Chapters \@ref(c-samples) and
\@ref(c-tables).

### A measure of association for ordinal variables {#ss-descr1-2cat-gamma}

In the previous example the explanatory variable (sex) had 2 categories
and the response variable (attitude) had 5. A full examination of the
individual conditional distributions of attitude given sex then involved
comparisons of five pairs of proportions, one for each level of the
attitude variable. This number gets larger still if the explanatory
variable also has several levels, as in the following example:

*Example: Importance of short-term gains for investors*

Information on the behaviour and expectations of individual investors
was collected by sending a questionnaire to a sample of customers of a
U.S. brokerage house.^[Lewellen, W. G., Lease, R. G., and Schlarbaum, G. G. (1977).
“Patterns of investment strategy and behavior among individual
investors”. *The Journal of Business*, **50**, 296–333. The
published article gave only the total sample size, the marginal
distributions of sex and age group, and conditional proportions for
the short-term gains variable given sex and age group. These were
used to create tables of frequencies separately for men and women
(assuming further that the age distribution was the same for both),
and Table \@ref(tab:t-investors) was obtained by combining these. The
resulting table is consistent with information in the article, apart
from rounding error.] One of the questions asked the respondents to
state how much importance they placed on quick profits (short-term
gains) as an objective when they invested money. The responses were
recorded in four categories as “Irrelevant”, “Slightly important”,
“Important” or “Very important”. Table \@ref(tab:t-investors) shows the
crosstabulation of this variable with the age of the respondent in four
age groups.

  : (\#tab:t-investors)Importance of short-term gains: Frequencies of respondents in the investment example, by age group
  and attitude towards short-term gains as investment goal. Conditional
  proportions of attitude given age group are shown in brackets. The
  value of the $\gamma$ measure of association is $-0.377$.

Here there are four conditional distributions, one for each age group,
and each of them is described by four proportions of different levels of
attitude. There are then many possible comparisons of the kind discussed
above. For example, we might want to compare the proportions of
respondents who consider short-term gains irrelevant between the oldest
and the youngest age group, the proportions for whom such gains are very
important between these two groups, or, in general, the proportions in
any category of the response variable between any two age groups.

Although pairwise comparisons like this are important and informative,
they can clearly become cumbersome when the number of possible
comparisons is large. A potentially attractive alternative is then to
try to summarise the strength of the association between the variables
in a single number, a **measure of association** of some kind. There are
many such measures for two-way contingency tables, labelled with a range
of Greek and Roman letters (e.g. $\phi$, $\lambda$, $\gamma$, $\rho$,
$\tau$, V, Q, U and d). The most useful of them are designed for tables
where both of the variables are measured at the ordinal level, as is the
case in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors). The ordering of the categories can then
be exploited to capture the strength of the association in a single
measure. This is not possible when at least one of the variables is
measured at the nominal level, as any attempt to reduce the patterns of
the conditional probabilities into one number will then inevitably
obscure much of the information in the table. It is better to avoid
measures of association defined for nominal variables, and to describe
their associations only through comparisons of conditional probabilities
as described in the previous section.

Here we will discuss only one measure of association for two-way tables
of ordinal variables. It is known as $\gamma$ (“gamma”). It
characterises one possible general pattern of association between two
ordinal variables, namely the extent to which high values of one
variable tend to be associated with high or low values of the other
variable. Here speaking of “low” and “high” values, or of “increasing”
or “decreasing” them, is meaningful when the variables are ordinal. For
example, in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors) the categories corresponding to the
bottom rows and right-most columns are in an obvious sense “high” values
of age and importance respectively.

Consider the conditional proportions of importance given age group shown
in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors). It is clear that, for example, the
proportion of respondents for whom short-term gains are very important
is highest in the youngest, and lowest in the oldest age group.
Similarly, the proportion of respondents for whom such gains are
irrelevant increases consistently from the youngest to the oldest group.
In other words, respondents with *high* values of the explanatory
variable (age group) tend to have *low* values the response variable
(importance of short-term gains). Such an association is said to be
*negative*. A *positive* association would be seen in a table where high
values of one variable were associated with high values of the other.

Measures of association for summarising such patterns are typically
based on the numbers of concordant and discordant pairs of observations.
Suppose we compare two units classified according to the two variables
in the table. These units form a *concordant pair* if one of them has a
higher value of both variables than the other. For example, consider two
respondents in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors), one with values (Under 45;
Irrelevant) and the other with (45–54; Important). This is a concordant
pair, because the second respondent has both a higher value of age group
(45–54 vs. Under 45) and a higher value of the importance variable
(Important vs. Irrelevant) than the first respondent. In contrast, in a
*discordant pair* one unit has a higher value of one variable but a
lower value of the other variable than the other unit. For example, a
pair of respondents with values (45–54; Very important) and (55–64;
Irrelevant) is discordant, because the latter has a higher value of age
group but a lower value of the importance variable than the former.
Pairs of units with the same value of one or both of the variables are
known as *tied* pairs. They are not used in the calculations discussed
below.

The $\gamma$ measure of association is defined as
\begin{equation}
\gamma=\frac{C-D}{C+D}
(\#eq:gamma)
\end{equation} where $C$ is the total number of concordant pairs in the
table, and $D$ is the number of discordant pairs. For Table
\@ref(tab:t-investors), the value of this is $\gamma=-0.377$.

Calculation of $C$ and $D$ is straightforward but tedious and
uninteresting, and can be left to a computer. Remembering the exact form
of (\@ref(eq:gamma)) is also not crucial. More important than the formula of
$\gamma$ (or any other measure of association) is its interpretation.
This can be considered on several levels of specificity, which are
discussed separately below. The discussion is relatively detailed, as
these considerations are relevant and useful not only for $\gamma$, but
also for all other measures of association in statistics.

The **sign** of the statistic: It can be seen from (\@ref(eq:gamma)) that
$\gamma$ is positive (greater than zero) when there are more concordant
pairs than discordant ones (i.e. $C>D$), and negative when there are
more discordant than concordant pairs ($C<D$). This also implies that
$\gamma$ will be positive when the association is positive in the sense
discussed above, and negative when the association is negative. A value
of $\gamma=0$ indicates a complete lack of association of this kind. In
Table \@ref(tab:t-investors) we have $\gamma=-0.377$, indicating a negative
association. This agrees with the conclusion obtained informally above.

The **extreme values** of the statistic: Clearly $\gamma=1$ if there are
no discordant pairs ($D=0$), and $\gamma=-1$ if there are no concordant
pairs ($C=0$). The values $\gamma=-1$ and $\gamma=1$ are the smallest
and largest possible values of $\gamma$, and indicate the strongest
possible levels of negative and positive association respectively. More
generally, the closer $\gamma$ is to $-1$ or 1, the stronger is the
(negative or positive) association.

The **formal interpretation** of the statistic: This refers to any way
of interpreting the value more understandably than just vaguely as a
measure of “strength of association”. Most often, such an intepretation
is expressed as a *proportion* of some kind. For $\gamma$, this is done
using a principle known as **Proportional reduction of error** (PRE).
Because the PRE idea is also used to interpret many other measures of
association in statistics, we will first describe it in general terms
which are not limited to $\gamma$.

Suppose we consider an explanatory variable $X$ and a response variable
$Y$, and want to make predictions of the values of $Y$ in a data set.
This is done twice, first in a way which makes no use of $X$, and then
in a way which predicts the value of $Y$ for each unit using information
on the corresponding value of $X$ and on the strength and direction of
the association between $X$ and $Y$. Recalling the connection between
association and prediction, it is clear that the second approach should
result in better predictions if the two variables are associated. The
comparison also reflects the *strength* of the association: the stronger
it is, the bigger is the improvement in prediction gained by utilising
information on $X$.

A PRE measure describes the size of this improvement. Suppose that the
magnitude or number of errors made in predicting the values of $Y$ in a
data set using the first scheme, i.e. ignoring information on $X$, is
somehow measured by a single number $E_{1}$, and that $E_{2}$ is the
same measure of errors for the second prediction scheme which makes use
of $X$. The difference $E_{1}-E_{2}$ is thus the improvement in
prediction achieved by the second scheme over the first. A PRE measure
of association is the ratio \begin{equation}
\text{PRE}= \frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{E_{1}},
(\#eq:PRE)
\end{equation} i.e. the improvement in predictions as a *proportion* of
the number of errors $E_{1}$ under the first scheme. This formulation is
convenient for interpretation, because a proportion is easily
understandable even if $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ themselves are expressed in
some unfamiliar units. The smallest possible value of (\@ref(eq:PRE)) is
clearly 0, obtained when $E_{2}=E_{1}$, i.e. when using information on
$X$ gives no improvement in predictions. The largest possible value of
PRE is 1, obtained when $E_{2}=0$, i.e. when $Y$ can be predicted
perfectly from $X$. The values 0 and 1 indicate no association and
perfect association respectively.

The $\gamma$ statistic is a PRE measure, although with a somewhat
convoluted explanation. Suppose that we consider a pair of observations
which is known to be either concordant or discordant (the PRE
interpretation of $\gamma$ ignores tied observations). One of the two
observations thus has a higher value of $X$ than the other. For example,
suppose that we consider two respondents in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors) from
different age groups. We are then asked to predict the *order* of the
values of $Y$, i.e. which of the two units has the higher value of $Y$.
In the example of Table \@ref(tab:t-investors), this means predicting whether
the older respondent places a higher or lower level of importance on
short-term gains than the younger respondent. Two sets of predictions
are again compared. The first approach makes the prediction at random
and with equal probabilities, essentially tossing a coin to guess
whether the observation with the higher value of $X$ has the higher or
lower value of $Y$. The second prediction makes use of information on
the direction of the association between $X$ and $Y$. If the association
is known to be negative (i.e. there are more discordant than concordant
pairs), every pair is predicted to be discordant; if it is positive,
every pair is predicted to be concordant. For example, in Table
\@ref(tab:t-investors) the association is negative, so we would always
predict that the older of two respondents places a lower value of
importance on short-term gains.

If these predictions are repeated for every non-tied pair in the table,
the expected number of incorrect predictions under the first scheme is
$E_{1}=(C+D)/2$. Under the second scheme it is $E_{2}=D$ if the
association is positive and $E_{2}=C$ if it is negative. Substituting
these into the general formula (\@ref(eq:PRE)) shows that the $\gamma$
statistic (\@ref(eq:gamma)) is of the PRE form when $\gamma$ is positive;
when it is negative, the absolute value of $\gamma$ (i.e. its value with
the minus sign omitted) is a PRE measure, and the negative sign of
$\gamma$ indicates that the association is in the negative direction. In
our example $\gamma=-0.377$, so age and attitude are negatively
associated. Its absolute value $0.377$ shows that we will make 37.7%
fewer errors if we predict for every non-tied pair that the older
respondent places less importance on short-term gains, compared to
predictions made by tossing a coin for each pair.

The final property of interest is the **substantive interpretation** of
the strength of association indicated by $\gamma$ for a particular
table. For example, should $\gamma=-0.377$ for Table \@ref(tab:t-investors)
be regarded as evidence of weak, moderate or strong negative association
between age and attitude? Although this is usually the most (or only)
interesting part of the interpretation, it is also the most difficult,
and one to which a statistician’s response is likely to be a firm “it
depends”. This is because the strength of associations we may expect to
observe depends on the variables under consideration: a $\gamma$ of 0.5,
say, might be commonplace for some types of variables but never observed
for others. Considerations of the magnitude of $\gamma$ are most useful
in comparisons of associations between the same two variables in
different samples or groups. For example, in Chapter \@ref(c-3waytables)
we will calculate $\gamma$ for the variables in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors)
separately for men and women (see Table \@ref(tab:t-investors3)). These turn
out to be very similar, so the strength of the association appears to be
roughly similar in these two groups.

Three further observations complete our discussion of $\gamma$:

-   Since “high” values of a variable were defined as ones towards the
    bottom and right of a table, reversing the order in which the
    categories are listed will also reverse the interpretation of “high”
    and “low” and of a “negative” or “positive” association. Such a
    reversal for one variable will change the sign of $\gamma$ but not
    its absolute value. For example, in Table \@ref(tab:t-investors) we could
    have listed the age groups from the oldest to the youngest, in which
    case we would have obtained $\gamma=0.377$ instead of
    $\gamma=-0.377$. Reversing the ordering of both of the variables
    will give the same value of $\gamma$ as when neither is reversed.
    The nature and interpretation of the association remain unchanged in
    each case.

-   $\gamma$ can also be used when one or both of the variables are
    dichotomous, but not when either is nominal and has more than
    two categories. If, for example, the table includes a nominal
    variable with four categories, there are 24 different and equally
    acceptable ways of ordering the categories, each giving a different
    value of $\gamma$ (or rather 12 different positive values and their
    negatives). An interpretation of the value obtained for any
    particular ordering is then entirely meaningless.

-   $\gamma$ can also be treated as an estimate of the corresponding
    measure of association in a population from which the observed table
    is a sample. To emphasise this, the symbol $\hat{\gamma}$ is
    sometimes used for the sample statistic we have discussed here,
    reserving $\gamma$ for the population parameter. It is then also
    possible to define significance tests and confidence intervals for
    the population $\gamma$. These are given, for example, in SPSS
    output for two-way tables. Here, however, we will not discuss them,
    but will treat $\gamma$ purely as a descriptive measure
    of association. Statistical inference on associations for two-way
    tables will be considered only in the context of a different test,
    introduced in Chapter \@ref(c-tables).

## Sample distributions of a single continuous variable {#s-descr1-1cont}

### Tabular methods {#ss-descr1-1cont-tab}

A table of frequencies and proportions or percentages is a concise and
easily understandable summary of the sample distribution of a
categorical variable or any variable for which only a small number of
different values have been observed. On the other hand, applying the
same idea to a continuous variable or a discrete variable with many
different values is likely to be less useful, because all of the
individual frequencies may be small. For example, in this section we
illustrate the methods using the GDP variable in the country data
introduced at the beginning of Section \@ref(s-descr1-examples). This has 99 different
values among the 155 countries, 66 of these values appear only once, and
the largest frequency (for 0.8) is five. A frequency table of these
values would be entirely unenlightening.

  Total               155       99.9
  ----------------------------------

  : (\#tab:t-gdp)Frequency distribution of GDP per capita in the country data.

Instead, we can count the frequencies for some *intervals* of values.
Table \@ref(tab:t-gdp) shows an example of this for the GDP variable. The
frequency on its first line shows that there are 49 countries with GDP
per capita of less than \$2000, the second line that there are 32
countries with the GDP per capita between \$2000 and \$4900 (these
values included), and so on. We have thus in effect first created an
ordinal categorical variable by grouping the original continuous GDP
variable, and then drawn a frequency table of the grouped variable in
the same way as we do for categorical variables. Some information about
the distribution of the original, ungrouped variable will be lost in
doing so, in that the exact values of the observations within each
interval are obscured. This, however, is a minor loss compared to the
benefit of obtaining a useful summary of the main features of the
distribution.

The intervals must be *mutually exclusive*, so that no value belongs to
more than one interval, and *exhaustive*, so that all values in the data
belong to some interval. Otherwise the choice is arbitrary, in that we
can choose the intervals in any way which is sensible and informative.
Often this is a question of finding the right balance between too few
categories (losing too much of the original information) and too many
categories (making the table harder to read).

### Graphical methods {#ss-descr1-1cont-graphs}

#### Histograms {-}

![(\#fig:f-hist-gdp)Histogram of GDP per capita in the country data, together with the
corresponding frequency polygon.](gdp){width="13.5cm"}

A **histogram** is the graphical version of a frequency table for a
grouped variable, like that in Table \@ref(tab:t-gdp). Figure
\@ref(fig:f-hist-gdp) shows a histogram for the GDP variable (the histogram
consists of the bars; the lines belong to a different graph, the
frequency polygon explained below). The basic idea of a histogram is
very similar to that of the bar chart, except that now the bars touch
each other to emphasise the fact that the original (ungrouped) variable
is considered continuous. Because the grouped variable is ordinal, the
bars of a histogram must be in the correct order.

A good choice of the grouping intervals of the variable and thus the
number of bars in the histogram is important for the usefulness of the
graph. If there are too few bars, too much information is obscured; if
too many, the shape of the histogram may become confusingly irregular.
Often the number of intervals used for a histogram will be larger than
what would be sensible for a table like \@ref(tab:t-gdp). Furthermore,
intervals like those in Table \@ref(tab:t-gdp) are not even allowed in a
histogram, because they are of different widths (of 2, 3, 5, 10 and 10
units for the first five, and unbounded for the last one). The intervals
in a histogram must be of equal widths, because otherwise the visual
information in it becomes distorted (at least unless the histogram is
modified in ways not discussed here). For example, the intervals in
Figure \@ref(fig:f-hist-gdp) (less than 2.5, 2.5–less than 5.0, 5.0–less than
7.5 etc.) are all 2.5 units wide. The exact choice can usually be left
to computer packages such as SPSS which use automatic rules for choosing
sensible intervals.

#### Frequency polygons {-}

Figure \@ref(fig:f-hist-gdp) also shows a **frequency polygon** of the GDP
variable. This is obtained by drawing lines to connect the mid-points of
the tops of the bars in a histogram. At each end of the histogram the
lines are further connected to zero, as if the histogram had additional
bars of zero height to the left and right of the smallest and largest
observed categories. The result is a curve with a similar shape as the
corresponding histogram, and its interpretation is similar to that of
the histogram.

A histogram is usually preferable to a frequency polygon for presenting
a single distribution, especially since histograms are typically much
easier to produce in standard software such as SPSS. However, frequency
polygons will later be useful for making comparisons between several
distributions.

#### Stem and leaf plots {-}

A **stem and leaf plot** is a close relative of the histogram, and is
used for much the same purposes, mostly in small data sets. It is
easiest to explain through an example, so let us consider the GDP
variable again. The stem and leaf plot for it is shown in Figure
\@ref(tab:t-stemgdp). First, note that the values of the variable in the
sample (from \$500 to \$37800, recorded as 0.5 to 37.8 thousands of
dollars) have at most three significant digits. If the observations have
too many digits to be convenient for a stem and leaf plot, they can be
rounded first; for example, if the GDP figures had actually been
recorded down to the last dollar, we would have rounded them to the
nearest hundred dollars (as in Table \@ref(tab:t-countrydata)) for the plot.
The last digit (here hundreds of dollars) will determine the *leaves*
for the plot, while other digits (here round thousands of dollars) will
define the *stem*.

  : (\#tab:t-stemgdp)Stem and leaf plot of GDP per capita in the country data (Stem=thousands of dollars, Leaf=hundreds of dollars).

The left-hand column in \@ref(tab:t-stemgdp) lists the stem values in the
data, from smallest (0) to the largest (37). Each data value with the
same stem is represented on the same line by its leaf, i.e. its last
digit. Thus the smallest value, 0.5 for Sierra Leone, is shown as a leaf
“5” on the “0” stem, East Timor (another 0.5) as another “5” next to it,
and so on up to the largest value 37.8 for Norway, shown as an “8” leaf
on the “37” stem.

The stem and leaf plot is very similar to a histogram (try turning
Figure \@ref(tab:t-stemgdp) on its side, and compare to Figure
\@ref(fig:f-hist-gdp)). It has the additional advantage that it also shows
the actual numerical values of the observations. In some rather special
cases this can reveal additional features of the data. Consider, for
example, the plot shown in Figure \@ref(tab:t-stemhours). The variable here
is the number of hours 86 respondents in a social survey (a small subset
of all the respondents, drawn purely for this illustration) reported
their *spouse* worked in the previous week. An obvious feature of the
plot is the prevalence of zeroes as the leaves, especially the many
observations with 40 reported hours. This suggests that most respondents
probably did not carefully recall and add up the exact hours their
spouses worked the previous week; instead, a round “40” is likely to be
effectively a synonym for “my spouse has a regular nine-to-five job”.
Such *digit preference* is quite common for many variables in surveys,
and serves as a reminder that our measurements are not always as precise
as they may appear.

The stems and leaves indicate tens of hours and single hours respectively.
The main disadvantage of a stem and leaf plot is that since every data
value is shown separately, the plot can only be used when the sample
size is relatively small. In such cases it is, however, a very useful
and user-friendly graph. Also, “small” does not mean “tiny”. For
example, the country data set has as many as $n=155$ observations, yet
Figure \@ref(tab:t-stemgdp) is still quite readable and fits on a single
page.

![(\#fig:f-boxplot-gdp)An annotated box plot of GDP per capita in the country data ($n=155$).](box_gdp){width="13.5cm"}

#### Box plots {-}

A **box plot** differs from the graphs discussed so far in that it does
not attempt to display the whole distribution, but only certain
characteristics of it. The quantities included in a box plot are some of
the summary statistics defined in Section \@ref(s-descr1-nums). To
introduce the idea, one box plot is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-boxplot-gdp).
The variable considered here is again GDP per capita. The vertical axis
shows possible values of the variable, and the plot itself contains the
following elements:

-   The line inside the central box is the **median** of the variable.
    Here it is 4.7.

-   The end points of the **box** are the **first and third quartile**
    of the variable, here 1.7 and 11.4 respectively. The length of the
    box is thus the interquartile range (IQR), here
    $\text{IQR}=11.4-1.7=9.7$. The range of values covered by the box
    contains the middle 50% of the observations. Half of the countries
    in this sample have GDPs between \$1700 and \$11400.

-   The two lines extending from the box on either side are known as the
    **whiskers**. Their length is determined as follows:

    -   Calculate the value of 1.5 times the IQR. This is the maximum
        length of each whisker. Here this is $1.5\times 9.7=14.6$

    -   The lower whisker extends to the smallest value (**minimum**) of
        the variable in the sample, or to the smallest value which is at
        most 1.5$\times$IQR units below the first quartile, whichever
        is larger. Here the minimum is 0.5, which is less than 14.6
        units below the first quartile of 1.7, so the lower whisker ends
        at 0.5.

    -   The upper whisker extends to the largest value (**maximum**) in
        the sample, or to the largest value which is at most
        1.5$\times$IQR units above the third quartile, whichever
        is smaller. Here the maximum is 37.8, which is further than the
        maximum distance of 14.6 above the third quartile of 11.4
        allowed for a whisker. Thus the upper whisker could be drawn at
        most to $11.4+14.6=26$. In this sample there are actually no
        observations of exactly 26, so the whisker ends at the next
        smallest observed value, which is 23.7.

-   If the mimimum is further than 1.5$\times$IQR below the first
    quartile, or maximum further than 1.5$\times$IQR above the third
    quartile, there are still observations which are not in the range
    spanned by the box and the whiskers. Such extreme observations are
    considered **outliers** in the plot. The values for each outlier are
    plotted separately as points. Here there are 15 different outlying
    values, all with large values of the variable (because in two cases
    two countries have the same value, these 15 points actually
    represent 17 countries).

A box plot thus shows some of the main features of a distribution with
the following visual cues:

-   The central line shows a central value (the median) of
    the distribution.

-   The box shows the location of the central bulk (middle 50%) of the
    observations

-   The whiskers show the range of the regular (non-outlying)
    observations.

-   Very extreme values (outliers), if any, are shown individually.

This can be quite effective for summarizing a distribution. For example,
a box plot where the median line is not roughly in the middle of the
box, or where one of the whiskers is much longer than the other,
indicates that the sample distribution is skewed in the direction of the
longer half of the box and the longer whisker. Here the distribution of
GDP per capita is clearly positively skewed, as we have already
observed. However, for a single distribution all such information and
more can also be obtained from a histogram. It is instead for
*comparisons* of distributions between two or more samples that box
plots are particularly convenient, because it is easy to place two or
more of them side by side. This will be illustrated later in Section
\@ref(ss-means-descr-graphs).

#### Other graphs for single variables {-}

Other types of graphs that are not described here are also sometimes
used for displaying distributions. One of them is a **pie chart**, which
shows the proportions of the levels of a categorical (or grouped
continuous) variable as sectors of a circle. The relative area of a
sector indicates the proportion of the category. We will not discuss pie
charts further here, because we do not find them particularly useful
(the same information can usually be presented more clearly in a table,
bar chart or histogram). That, however, is partly a matter of taste, and
there is nothing inherently wrong with (clearly and properly presented)
pie charts.

## Numerical descriptive statistics {#s-descr1-nums}

 The tabular and graphical methods discussed above
aim to display the whole sample distribution of a variable in an
understandable form. The methods introduced in this section have a
different purpose. Each of them is used to summarize some important
single feature of the distribution in one number. In general, any such
number calculated from the data is called a **statistic**. When it is
used for data description, it is a **descriptive statistic**, also known
as a **summary statistic**. This creates some terminological confusion,
as the phrase “descriptive statistics” can mean either all statistical
methods used for description or those statistics (i.e. numbers
calculated from the data) with a descriptive purpose. The difference is
usually unimportant or clear from the context.

The two salient features of a distribution for which we will define
descriptive statistics are its *central tendency* and its *variation*.

### Measures of central tendency {#ss-descr1-nums-central}

If you were allowed to know only one feature of the sample distribution
of a variable, chances are you would ask for something like its most
typical value, the middle value, or the average value — in short, you
would be interested in a measure of *central tendency*. We will discuss
three such measures below: the mode, the median and the mean
(corresponding, respectively, to the phrases “most typical”, “middle”
and “average” used above).

#### The mode {-}

The **mode** is the value of the variable which occurs most often in the
data, i.e. the one with the highest frequency. For example, Tables
\@ref(tab:t-region) and \@ref(tab:t-democ) show that the mode of the region
variable in the country data is “Africa” and the mode of the democracy
score is 0. The GDP variable has two modes, 0.8 and 1.9, which both
appear five times (a distribution can have several modes; one with two
modes is said to be *bimodal*).

The mode can be used for variables of any measurement level. For
*nominal* variables it is the only available measure of central
tendency, as the median and the mean are not appropriate for such
variables.

The mode does not need to be a *central* value in the sense that it can
even be the largest or smallest value of the variable, if this occurs
most often. This is the case for the democracy index in our example.

The mode is most useful for categorical variables, where the number of
possible values is small, and the most common value thus has a high
frequency. With continuous variables (like GDP) and discrete variables
with many different values, the mode may be unstable and misleading. For
example, it is perfectly possible that all but one value appear once
each in a sample, and the mode is the value which happens to occur
twice.

#### The median {-}

Suppose that the values of a variable in a sample are first ordered from
the smallest to the largest. For example, in Table \@ref(tab:t-countrydata)
the countries are ordered in this way according to their GDP (starting
from the bottom of the table). The **median** is the value which falls
in the middle of this ordering, so that it divides the observed values
into two halves. Because this requires a meaningful ordering of the
values, the median is appropriate only for ordinal and interval-level
variables, but not for nominal ones.

More specifically, suppose that there are $n$ observations, indexed from
1 for the smallest to $n$ for the largest. The index of the middle
observation is then $(n+1)/2$. If $n$ is an odd number, the median is
simply the observation in the ordered sample with this index. If $n$ is
even, $(n+1)/2$ falls between two whole numbers, and the median is the
mean (of the kind defined below) of the observations with these two
indices. For example, in the country data set $n=155$ (an odd number),
and $(n+1)/2=78$, so the median is the value of the 78th observation in
the ordered sample; if instead there had been $n=156$ countries,
$(n+1)/2=78.5$, so the median would have been the mean of the 78th and
79th observations.

In the country data set the median of the democracy score is 6, and the
median GDP is \$4700 (the 78th observation in GDP order is Paraguay). In
practice these are of course found using a a computer package like SPSS.
For an ordinal categorical variable like the democracy score the median
can also be found easily from the frequency table by considering the
*cumulative percentages* (or proportions) of the categories. These are
obtained by adding up the percentages up to and including each category,
as shown in the last column of Table \@ref(tab:t-democ). The median is then
the category in which the cumulative percentage reaches or passes 50%.
For the democracy index this happens for the score of 6, which has a
cumulative percentage of 50.9%.

#### The mean {-}

The **mean** is the best-known and most widely used measure of central
tendency. It is also known as the **average**. To define the mean, we
need to introduce our first pieces of mathematical notation. Suppose
first that the variable of interest is denoted by $Y$. In practice the
variable is of course called something else, like GDP or Age or Income,
but in the formulas below it is much more convenient to refer to any
such variable generically by one letter (note also that the choice of
the letter itself is arbitrary; for example, you may often see $X$ used
instead of $Y$ when the mean is defined). Individual observations of $Y$
are denoted generically by $Y_{i}$, where the subscript $i$ identifies a
single subject. The values of $i$ range from $1$ to $n$, so all of the
observations in the sample are $Y_{1},
Y_{2}, \dots, Y_{n}$, e.g. in the country example (with $n=155$) $Y_{1},
Y_{2}, \dots, Y_{155}$. The ordering of the observations is arbitrary
here, so it might for example be the order in which they are listed in
your SPSS data file. The mean $\bar{Y}$ (“Y-bar”) of the observations of
$Y$ in the sample is defined as \begin{equation}
\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum Y_{i}}{n}.
(\#eq:Ybar)
\end{equation} Here $n$ is again the sample size. The symbol $\Sigma$
(upper-case Greek letter “Sigma”) is a *summation symbol*, which
indicates that we calculate the sum of all $Y_{i}$ (often this is stated
more explicitly by the notation $\sum_{i} Y_{i}$ or
$\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}$ to make it clear that the summation is over all
the values of $i$). In other words, (\@ref(eq:Ybar)) is a concise expression
for $$\bar{Y}= \frac{Y_{1}+Y_{2}+\dots+Y_{n}}{n}$$ or, in English,
“calculate the sum of all the observations of the variable $Y$ in the
sample, and divide this sum by the number of observations to obtain the
mean of $Y$ in the sample”. For example, for GDP per capita this
calculation gives
$$\bar{Y}= \frac{37.8+37.8+32.7+\dots+0.6+0.5+0.5}{155}
=\frac{1335.1}{155}=8.6$$ (rounded to one decimal place), i.e. mean GDP
among these countries is about \$8600.

Because the mean requires arithmetical calculations (summation and
division) on the observations $Y_{i}$, it is strictly speaking only
appropriate for interval level variables, but not for ordinal ones, for
which the numbers of the categories are ordered labels rather than real
numbers. However, it is common to see this instruction ignored and means
calculated for ordinal variables, especially when they have a large
number of categories (see also the discussion under "Measurement Levels" in Section
\@ref(ss-intro-def-vartypes)). For example, the mean democracy
score in our sample (using the codes 0–10 as its values) is 5.4. This
may be used as a summary of the central tendency of the variable, but it
should not be overinterpreted as its meaning is not quite as clear as
that of, say, mean GDP.

For interval level variables the mean is by far the most commonly used
measure of central tendency. It does, however, have one arguably
undesirable feature. This is illustrated by the statistics for the GDP
variable, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-countries-sums). Its mean (\$8600) is
clearly much larger than the median (\$4700). This is due to the shape
of the distribution of GDP, as revealed by Figure \@ref(fig:f-hist-gdp) or
even more clearly by the stem and leaf plot of Figure \@ref(tab:t-stemgdp).
While most of the countries are concentrated around a fairly narrow
range of GDPs, there are also a number of countries with much larger
GDPs. The ranges of values in the small and large ends of the values in
a distribution are (for fairly obvious visual reasons) called the
**tails** of the distribution. A distribution with a (much) longer tail
in one end than the other is said to be **skewed**. A distribution like
that of GDP in Figure \@ref(fig:f-hist-gdp), with its long tail towards the
large values, is said to be **skewed to the right** or **positively
skewed**. A distribution shown in panel A of Figure \@ref(fig:f-skews) is
**skewed to the left** (**negatively skewed**): while the examination
marks of most students are relatively high, there are some students with
very low marks. A distribution which has no clear skewness in either
direction, like the distribution of typical weekly working hours in
panel B of Figure \@ref(fig:f-skews) is (approximately) **symmetric**.

The mean is almost always further in the direction of skewness than the
median. That is why the mean of the positively skewed GDP variable is
larger than its median. In general, a comparison between the two
statistics will reveal the direction of any skewness, and give an
indication of its magnitude. When the difference is large, as it is
here, it is typically sensible to report both the mean and the median.

The mean is sensitive even to individual observations far in the tails
of the distribution. Such observations, which are very different (much
larger or smaller) from the rest of the data, are known as **outliers**.
Even a single outlier can, if it is extreme enough, pull the mean far
towards itself, even beyond the range of all the other observations, as
in the following example:

*Example: A sample with an outlier*\
Suppose that an M.Sc. student, preparing her dissertation on elements of
social capital in Canada, is examining various measures of community
activities in a sample of fourty municipalities in the province of
Manitoba.^[This is a random sample of municipalities, obtained for this
illustration from the 2001 census data provided by Statistics Canada
at <http://www.statcan.gc.ca>.] As part of an initial description of these communities,
she wants to summarize their populations, which are

5, 79, 143, 226, 303, 317, 384, 417, 448, 505, 524, 525, 538, 619, 621,
629, 637, 760, 801, 906, 955, 959, 964, 1047, 1111, 1152, 1457, 1491,
1722, 1907, 2079, 2405, 2723, 3950, 4012, 4032, 4183, 4427, 12602,
619544.

The outlier in this case is the city of Winnipeg, whose population of
nearly 620,000 is 49 times as large as that of the next largest
municipality in the sample. With it included in the sample, the mean
population of the 40 municipalities is about 17000; without it, the mean
for the other 39 is 1600. The two numbers give rather different pictures
of the size of an “average” community in the data (similar differences
would probably be observed for other variables too, so the large city
would be an outlier in many respects in a study like this). The median,
on the other hand, is 906 for the 39 smaller communities, and 930.5 with
Winnipeg included. It is thus essentially unaffected by the outlier,
basically because it is only influenced by the fact that 619,554 is
bigger than the mid-point of the data, but not by how much bigger it is.

### Measures of variation {#ss-descr1-nums-variation}

A measure of central tendency is not a complete summary of a
distribution, in that there can be distributions which have the same
central tendency but which are different in some other respect. To
illustrate this with a hypothetical example, suppose we are studying the
students in three classrooms of the same grade at a local school. Each
class has 14 students, and all students have just taken the same test,
graded 1 (low) to 10 (high). The marks of the students are found to be
as shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-classmarks).

 Both the mean and the median of the marks are 6 in
every class. However, the classes are otherwise clearly not similar. In
particular, the **variation** (or **dispersion**) of the marks is very
different. There is no variation at all in Class 1 where everyone has
the same score, and quite a lot of variation in Class 3, while Class 2
seems to fall between the two. To capture this, some **measure of
variation** will be needed. Three such measures are described here. All
of them stricly speaking require the variable to be measured at an
interval level, because they involve calculations of differences between
its values. Using them on an ordinal variable is thus subject to similar
cautions as for the mean above. These measures of variation are entirely
inappropriate for nominal-level variables. There are some measures which
can be used for such variables, but they are not described here.

  ---------- --------------------------------

  : (\#tab:t-classmarks)A hypothetical examples of test marks of students in three classes.

#### Range {-}

The **range** of a variable is simply the difference between its largest
and smallest observed values (the **maximum** and **minimum** in
statistical terminology). In the class example above,

Class 1: Range $= 6-6 =0$\
Class 2: Range $= 8-4 =4$\
Class 3: Range $= 10-1 =9$

The measure is largest for Class 3 and smallest for Class 1, so it seems
to capture the differences in variation suggested by an initial look at
the numbers themselves. For Class 1 the range is 0, because all of the
observations are the same. In general, any sensible measure of variation
should be zero when there is no variation (all observations are
identical), and all of the measures described here have that property.

In the country data, the range of GDP is \$37800-\$500=\$37300, and the
range of the democracy score (if we cautiously treat it as an
interval-level variable) is 10-0=10.

#### Interquartile range {-}

The range is often not a particularly useful measure of variation,
because it depends *only* on the two extremes of the data. It is thus
very sensitive to outliers. If, for example, there is one large outlier,
the range will be large even if all of the other observations are very
similar to each other.

One way to reduce the effects of outliers is to ignore the tails of the
distribution and consider the variation only among the central range of
the data. This idea is expressed in the **Interquartile range**. First
we have to define the quartiles:

-   **The first quartile** is the value such that 25% (one quarter) of
    the observations are smaller than (or equal to) it, and 75%
    (three quarters) bigger than (or equal to) it.

-   **The third quartile** is the value such that 75% of the
    observations are smaller than (or equal to) it, and 25% bigger than
    (or equal to) it.

The quartiles are thus similar in spirit to the median. Just as the
median divides the observations into two equal halves (those below and
those above the median), the quartiles divide them into two groups at
different points. For example, the first quartile divides the
observations into the smallest 25% and the remaining largest 75%. (The
median can thus also be described as the *second quartile*, and all of
these statistics are special cases of a larger class of similar
statistics known as *percentiles*.)

The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third and
the first quartile. It is the range of the middle 50% of the
observations, leaving out the smallest 25% and the largest 25%. This
effectively eliminates the effects of any outliers, so IQR is a useful
measure of variation (often used together with the median as measure of
central tendency) when there are serious outliers or when the
distribution is very skewed.

For the class example the interquartile ranges are

Class 1: IQR $= 6-6 =0$\
Class 2: IQR $= 7-5 =2$\
Class 3: IQR $= 9.25-2.75 =6.5$

These are again in the expected order.^[There is no need to worry about how the quartile values 9.25 and
2.75 for class 3 were calculated. Different software packages may in
fact do that slightly differently; these values are from SPSS.] For the country data, the
first and third quartiles for GDP are 1.7 and 11.4 respectively, and
IQR=11.4-1.7=9.7. For the democracy score the quartiles are 1 and 9, and
IQR=8.

#### Standard deviation {-}

The most commonly used measure of variation is based on the
**deviations** $$Y_{i}-\bar{Y}$$ where $Y_{i}$ again denotes an
individual observation of a variable, and $\bar{Y}$ is its mean. A
deviation is the difference between an individual observation and the
average value in the sample. Table \@ref(tab:t-sdex) shows the deviations for
Class 3 in the class example, together with the other calculations
discussed below. Here a negative deviation indicates that an observation
is smaller than the mean of 6 (e.g. $1-6=-5$), and a positive deviation
that an observation is larger than the mean (e.g. $10-6=+4$).

  : (\#tab:t-sdex)Calculating the standard deviation of test marks for Class 3 in the
  class example at the beginning of Section \@ref(ss-descr1-nums-variation).

The deviations are clearly related to variation, as a sample with little
variation will have small deviations (most observations are close to the
mean) and one with a lot of variation will have many large deviations
(many observations are far from the mean). All that remains is to
aggregate them in some sensible way into a single number.

An inappropriate summary of the deviations is their mean, i.e. $\sum
(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})/n$. In the class example this turns out to be zero (see
the second column of Table \@ref(tab:t-sdex)), and not by coincidence. It can
be shown that the mean of the deviations is in fact zero for any set of
numbers. This happens because positive and negative deviations will
always exactly cancel out each other in the sum. This is clearly not
what we want, because a negative deviation of, say, $-2$ (an observation
two units below the mean) should be equally strong evidence of variation
as a positive deviation of +2 (an observation two units above the mean).
The signs of the deviations thus need to be eliminated somehow. Just
dropping the negative signs (so that $-2$ becomes 2) means calculating
the *absolute values* of the deviations, denoted $|Y_{i}-\bar{Y}|$.
Taking the mean of these gives the **mean absolute deviation** or MAD,
defined as $$\text{MAD}=\frac{\sum |Y_{i}-\bar{Y}|}{n}.$$ This is a
perfectly sensible measure of variation, but it is not very commonly
used. This is largely because absolute values are mathematically rather
difficult to work with, and this would make MAD very inconvenient for
more sophisticated analyses, where measures of variation will also be
needed.^[In mathematical terms, the difficulty is that the absolute value
function has no derivative at zero.] Instead, we eliminate the signs of the deviations by using
their squares $(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}$, i.e. by multiplying each deviation
by itself (c.f. the third column of Table \@ref(tab:t-sdex) for an
illustration). These are used to calculate the **variance**, denoted
$s^{2}$ and defined as \begin{equation}
s^{2} = \frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}{n-1}.
(\#eq:samplevar)
\end{equation} This is (apart from the $n-1$ rather than $n$ as the
divisor) essentially the mean of the squared deviations. Its units of
measurement are also squares of the units of the original measurements.
For example, the variance of the GDP variable, which is itself measured
in (thousands of) dollars, is expressed in dollars squared. This is
rather inconvenient for any meaningful interpretation. To obtain a
measure of variation expressed in the original units, we can take the
square root (indicated below by $\sqrt{\; \; }$) of the variance. This
statistic is the **standard deviation**, often abbreviated as S.D.,
denoted by $s$ and defined as
\begin{equation}
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}{n-1}.}
(\#eq:sd)
\end{equation} For the class example, this is 0 for Class 1, 1.3 for Class
2, and 3.4 for class 3. In the country data, the standard deviation of
GDP is \$9450 and that of the democracy score (if it is treated as an
interval-level variable) is 3.9, as shown in Table
\@ref(tab:t-countries-sums).

Like the mean, the standard deviation is sensitive to outliers and
skewness of the distribution, so sometimes other measures of variation
(e.g. IQR or MAD) should be reported instead of, or in addition to it.
Nevertheless, the standard deviation is by far the most commonly used
measure of variation. One reason for this is that it is very important
not just as a descriptive statistic but also as an element in several
forms of statistical inference. For description it is typically less
immediately interpretable than measures of central tendency. Often the
most revealing descriptive uses of the standard deviation are in
comparisons between samples, like in the class example above. The
following is a real example of this kind, where variation was in fact of
more interest than central tendency:

*Example: Variation in rates of economic growth*\
In an article titled “Dancing in step” on November 13th 2004, *The
Economist* discussed a set of data (collected by the J. P. Morgan Chase
bank) on the annual growth rates (in percentage points) of the Gross
Domestic Products (GDP) of 30 countries for each year since 1971.
Measures of central tendency, such as average growth rates for each
country and each year, are clearly interesting in this case. However,
most of the discussion in the article concerned *variation* in growth
rates, measured by their standard deviation across countries for each
year, and especially changes in this variation over time. The standard
deviation of growth rates was around 3–5 percentage points for every
year until the early 1990s, had fallen to about 2 percentage points in
2003, and was forecast to decline further in subsequent years. There had
thus previously been a fair amount of variation in rates of economic
growth (with some economies growing faster and some slower, some perhaps
being in recession), whereas recently the growth rates had become more
similar across countries. The article summarized this in its subtitle as
“The world’s economies are more synchronised than ever before”, and went
on to discuss the implications of this development for global economy.

The formula (\@ref(eq:sd)) for the standard deviation involves the divisor
$n-1$, where the discussion leading up to it might make you expect $n$
instead. The reasons for this will be discussed briefly in Section
\@ref(ss-contd-popdistrs-params). The definition is not entirely
consistent in that some textbooks do use $n$ instead of $n-1$. The
difference is of no great importance, and using either $n$ or $n-1$
would be fine for our purposes. Whenever $n$ is even moderately large,
the difference between $n$ and $n-1$ is in any case small, and both
definitions of standard deviation give very similar values.

Finally, measures of central tendency and measures of variation, even
though they summarise the two most important features of a sample
distribution of a variable, may still miss some important features of
the distribution. Consider, for example, the class marks in Classes 2
and 3 in our hypothetical example. These are summarized by the bar
charts of Figure \@ref(fig:f-classbars). The distribution for Class 2 is
symmetric and concentrated around the mean value of 6. The most
noticeable feature of the marks in Class 3, on the other hand, is that
there appear to be two distinct groups of students, one with very low
scores and one with high scores. A similar feature was also noted in the
distribution of the democracy index in the country data (c.f. Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bars-democ)). This property would not be revealed by measures of
central tendency or variation, so it is an illustration of why it is
always sensible to also examine the whole distribution of a variable
using frequency tables or graphical methods.

right).](classbars){height="8.3cm"}

## Associations which involve continuous variables {#s-descr1-2cont}

Bivariate descriptive methods which are designed for situations where at
least one of the two variables is continuous are not described here but
in later sections:

-   Explanatory variable is categorical and response variable
    continuous: Parallel histograms, frequency polygons and box plots
    (Section \@ref(s-means-descr)).

-   Both explanatory and response variables are continuous: Scatter
    plots and line plots (Section \@ref(ss-regression-descr-plots)).

We do not discuss the remaining possibility, where the explanatory
variable is continuous and the response is categorical. The simplest and
usually quite sufficient way to give an initial description of the
associations in this case is to group the explanatory variable into a
categorical variable and then apply the methods of Section
\@ref(s-descr1-2cat).

## Presentation of tables and graphs {#s-descr1-presentation}

The purpose of statistical tables and graphs is to communicate
information correctly, clearly and effectively. If they do not do that,
that is, if they leave the reader misled, confused or uninformed, they
have failed and should not have been shown at all. Creating good tables
and graphics is not only a matter of understanding the technical details
described above. It also involves general principles of design and
presentation. Most of these should be simple common sense but clearly
are not, judging by the many entirely unhelpful tables and graphs
appearing in all kinds of publications. This section discusses very
briefly some principles of good practice in presenting descriptive
statistics in tables and graphs. Much of the section is based on two
books, *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* by Edward
R. Tufte (Graphics Press, 1983) and *Visual Revelations* by Howard
Wainer (Copernicus, 1997). These can be consulted for further
information and examples of both good and bad practice.

First, a reader of a table or graph should be able to understand what it
is about:

-   The variables should be labelled clearly. In particular, the names
    used in computer data files should not be used unless they are also
    understandable words. So even if a variable is called ATTDFOXH in
    your SPSS file, it should still be labelled “Attitude to
    foxhunting”or something similar in presentation. Similarly, the
    categories of variables should be labelled in words
    wherever appropriate.

-   Items such as the columns of a table or the vertical axis of a bar
    chart should also be labelled clearly (e.g. whether they are for
    frequencies or percentages).

-   More generally, a table or figure and its caption should be
    (within reason) as self-contained as possible, in that the reader
    should be able to understand them with little reference to the rest
    of the text for explanation (remember that tables and figures often
    float, i.e. they may appear on a different page from where they are
    referred to in the main text). This may also include giving the
    source of the data in a note or caption to the table or figure.

Some guidelines for constructing tables are

-   A table produced by software such as SPSS, although it contains the
    necessary numbers, is rarely suitable for presentation directly.
    Tables included in research reports should be retyped
    and reformatted.

-   The categories of the variable should be in a sensible order. For
    ordinal variables (including those obtained by grouping a continuous
    one), this should obviously be the natural ordering of the
    categories. For a nominal variable, the order can be chosen in
    whichever way is most useful for presentation. Often it makes sense
    to order categories from the largest to the smallest, typically
    leaving any “Others” category last.

-   If only proportions or percentages are shown, the sample size $n$
    should also be reported, perhaps in a note or caption to the table.
    This will allow the reader to judge how informative the table is. A
    percentage of 20% is clearly richer information when it corresponds
    to a frequency of 2,000 in a sample 10,000 than when it means 2 out
    of 10 observations. When $n$ is very small, proportions and
    percentages should be avoided altogether: reporting 1 out 7 as 14.3%
    is simply nonsensical.

-   Proportions and percentages can and should be rounded. It is rarely
    necessary to see percentages with more than one decimal place, if
    even that.

With graphs, it is always useful to bear in mind Wainer’s principle:

**The aim of good data graphics is to**\
**display data accurately and clearly**

The way to produce *bad* graphs is thus to break some part of this, for
example by (1) not showing much data, (2) showing much that is not data,
(3) showing the data inaccurately, or (4) obscuring the data. Graphs
with these characteristics are a form of visual lying, distorting the
graphical cues in a plot in ways which make it difficult or impossible
to obtain accurate information from it.

One example of a lying graph already mentioned is the “cut” bar chart
where the bars do not begin at zero. Another is the pseudo third
dimension, an example of which is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-yuk). The
information presented in this graph is the same as that of Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bars-region), i.e. frequencies of different regions. These are
represented by the heights of the bars. The additional information
conveyed by the apparent thickness of the bars, represented in
perspective to give an illusion of three-dimensional bars, is then —
exactly nothing. The fake third dimension represents no data, and serves
only to distort the real data that are being shown.

We can thus give a simple instruction: using a fake third dimension like
the one in Figure \@ref(fig:f-yuk) is always wrong and not acceptable under
any circumstances. This is true irrespective of the fact that such
graphs are often seen and easily (often almost automatically) produced
by software packages like Microsoft Excel. All this proves is that the
programmers of those packages have little graphical sense, or perhaps
that their companies have discovered that their customers are willing to
pay for such “features” as colourful but pointless graphs. Indeed, many
if not most of the graph styles provided by, say, Excel (exploding pie
charts, doughnuts, cones, pyramids and so on) are entirely useless for
accurate presentation of data.

![(\#fig:f-yuk)An example of an unacceptable graph: a bar chart with a pseudo
three-dimensional effect. The data are the same as in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bars-region).](threeD){height="8cm"}

An objection sometimes offered to such a severe rule is that bad graphs
“look good”. This can be answered in two ways. First, a statistical
graphic is not a decoration, but a tool for presenting information.
Authors who confuse the two often end up displaying pretty colours and
strange shapes to hide the lack of actual information in a graph.
Second, even in an aesthetic sense a useful and accurate graph is
preferable to a bad one, in the way that any well-designed object with a
function tends to be more attractive than a badly designed one.

What, then, is the recipe for good graphics? Mostly this is just a
matter of using basic graph types in a sensible and restrained manner,
focusing on presenting information and avoiding all distracting
decoration. Some such examples have been given earlier in this chapter.
Other types of graphs are used to illustrate associations between
variables, which we have not yet discussed. To anticipate that a little,
Figure \@ref(fig:f-houseprices) shows one (good but not in any way
exceptional) example of such graphs. It is a reproduction of a graph
originally published in a survey of Spain in *The Economist*, and shows
changes in average house prices in Spain, Germany and Britain between
1993 and 2003. Even without an introductory statistics course, the main
message of Figure \@ref(fig:f-houseprices) is immediately clear: increases in
Spanish house prices over the period have been comparable to those in
Britain, with prices more than doubling in both countries, and very
unlike those in Germany, where the prices have remained unchanged. Note
also that the graph distinguishes between the lines for different
countries by using different types of line. Different colours can of
course be used instead, but their differences will become obscured if
the graph is photocopied or printed in black and white.

![(\#fig:f-houseprices)An example of an informative graph: house prices in three countries
between 1993 and 2003, indexed to 100 in 1993. Source: *The Economist*, June 26th, 2004. The numbers
were estimated from the graph in the magazine, so they are
approximate.](houseprices){width="10cm"}

In addition to such modest but sensible and useful basic graphs, you may
sometimes encounter inspired examples of special graphs which manage to
describe particular data sets in exceptionally vivid and informative
ways. Some such examples are shown at
<http://www.datavis.ca/gallery/index.php>, on the web page maintained by
Michael Friendly at York University in Canada (unfortunately, however,
the electronic images do not always do justice to the originals; crisper
versions can be found in the books mentioned above). For example, the
page shows what Edward Tufte has described as possibly “the best
statistical graphic ever drawn”. This is Charles Joseph Minard’s
graphical memorial, drawn in 1861, to the fate of Napoleon I’s army in
their invasion of Russia in 1812. For contrast, the page also shows a
number of examples of visual lying and other terrible graphs, including
a mould-breaking re-intrepretation of the idea of a pie chart by Fox
News, and a colourful effort that Tufte has called possibly “the worst
graphic ever to find its way into print”. Clearly not all pictures tell
us as much as a thousand words.

## Appendix: Country data {#s-descr1-app}

The data used for illustration throughout this chapter are given in
Table \@ref(tab:t-countrydata). The variables are defined as follows:

-   **region** indicates the macro region where the country is located,
    coded as 1=Africa, 2=Asia, 3=Europe, 4=Latin America, 5=Northern
    America, 6=Oceania. The list of regions and the assignment of
    countries to regions are those used by the UN Statistics Division
    (see <unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm>).

-   **democracy** is a measure of institutionalised democracy by the
    Polity IV project.^[Monty G. Marshall and Keith Jaggers (2002). *Polity IV Dataset*.
    \[Computer file; version p4v2002\] College Park, MD: Center for
    International Development and Conflict Management, University of
    Maryland.] The values refer to each country’s
    classification in 2002. The variable has an 11-point scale from 0
    (lowest level of democracy) to 10 (highest). Countries coded as
    being in the state of “interruption” or “interregnum” have
    been omitted.

-   **GDP** is the country’s Gross Domestic Product per capita (in
    thousands of U.S. dollars), adjusted for purchasing power parity.
    The data were obtained from CIA’s *The World Factbook 2004*
    (<https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/>). The figures refer to
    slightly different years for different countries.

The data set contains those 155 countries for which recent data on all
of the three variables were available at the time the example created.
