<h4>Using the networked computers at LSE</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>To access IT facilities at LSE you need an IT account with its <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong>. Please see <code>http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/IMT/</code><br />
<code>guides/accounts/activateAccount.aspx</code> for instructions on how to activate your account. In case of any problems, please ask for assistance at the IT help desk (Library 1st floor).</p></li>
<li><p>Various introductory <strong>documents</strong> can be accessed through the IMT services web pages at <code>http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/IMT/home.aspx</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging in</strong> to use Windows: When you arrive at a networked computer, wait for Windows to start up (if the machine is not already on). Type in <strong>CTRL + ALT + Delete</strong> and the <strong>Enter Network Password</strong> screen will appear. Type in your username and your password and press <strong>Enter</strong> or click on the <strong>OK</strong> button. This will log you on to the computer.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-downloading" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Data downloading</h4>
<p>The instructions for each class will give the name of a file or files which will be used for that exercise. In order to do the class, you will need to download the file to your H: space (i.e.Â your personal file storage space on the LSE network, shown as disk drive H: on a networked computer once you have logged on). You can download all the data files for the course, as well as other course-related material, from the web-based <strong>Moodle</strong> system. See instructions in Chapter <a href="index.html#c-course-information">1</a> for how to register for MY451 on Moodle.</p>

<div id="general-information-and-documentation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>General information and documentation</h4>
<p>SPSS (formerly Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a widely used general-purpose statistical software package. It will be used for all the computer classes on this course. The current version on the LSE network is SPSS 21. This section gives some general information on the structure and use of SPSS. The discussion is brief and not meant to be comprehensive. The instructions given here and in the descriptions of individual computer classes below will be sufficient for the purposes of this course. If, however, you wish to find out more about SPSS, more information and examples can be found in the SPSS help files and tutorials found under the <strong>Help</strong> menu of the program, and in introductory guide books such as</p>
<p>Field, A.Â (2013). <em>Discovering Statistics using IBM SPSS Statistics</em> (4th ed). Sage. Kinnear, P.Â R.Â and Gray, C.Â D.Â (2012). <em>SPSS 19 Made Simple</em>. Psychology Press. Pallant, J. (2013). <em>SPSS Survival Manual</em> (5th ed). Open University Press.</p>
<p>These are given here purely as examples (there are many others) and not as recommendations. We have not reviewed any of these books in detail and so cannot make any comparisons between them.</p>
</div>
<div id="starting-spss" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Starting SPSS</h4>
<p>To start SPSS, double-click on the SPSS icon on the Windows desktop. Alternatively, click on the <strong>Start</strong> button at the bottom left corner, and select <strong>All Programs</strong>, then <strong>Specialist and teaching software</strong>, <strong>Statistics</strong>, <strong>SPSS</strong>, and finally <strong>SPSS 21</strong> (or some obvious variant of these, in case the exact wording on your desktop is slightly different).</p>
<p>An initial screen for opening data files appears. Click on <strong>Cancel</strong> to get rid of this and to enter the data editor (which will be discussed further below).</p>
</div>
<div id="exiting-from-spss" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Exiting from SPSS</h4>
<p>Select <strong>Exit</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu or click on the X at the upper right corner of the SPSS data editor window. You may then be prompted to save the information in the open windows; in particular, you should save the contents of the data editor in a file (see below) if you have made any changes to it.</p>
</div>
<div id="spss-windows" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>SPSS windows</h4>
<p>There are several different types of windows in SPSS. The two most important are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data editor</strong>: A data set is displayed in the Data Editor window. Several of these can be open at a time. The data editor which you have selected (clicked on) most recently defines the active data set, and the procedures you request from the menus are applied to this data set until you select a different active data set. The data editor window has two parts, accessed by clicking on the two tabs at the bottom of the window:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data view</strong>, which shows the data matrix in the spreadsheet-like form discussed in Section <a href="c-intro.html#ss-intro-def-subj">2.2.1</a>, with units in the rows and variables in the columns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variable view</strong>, which shows information about the variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Working with the data editor will be practised in the first computer class. The contents of the data editor, i.e.the data matrix and associated information, can be saved in an SPSS data file. Such files have names with the extension <strong>.sav</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Output viewer</strong>: Output from statistical analyses carried out on the data will appear here. The output can be printed directly from the viewer or copied and pasted to other programs. The contents of the viewer can also be saved in a file, with a name with the extension <strong>.spv</strong> (since version 17; in previous versions of SPSS the extension was <strong>.spo</strong>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also other windows, for example for editing SPSS graphs. They will be discussed in the instructions to individual computer classes where necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="menus" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Menus</h4>
<p>SPSS has a menu-based interface, which can be used to access most of its features for statistical analysis, manipulation of data, loading, saving and printing files, and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The procedures for statistical analysis are found under the <strong>Analyze</strong> menu, which provides further drop-down menus for choosing different methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, procedures for various statistical graphics are found under <strong>Graphs</strong>. We will be using procedures found under <strong>Graphs / Legacy Dialogs</strong>. Here âlegacyâ means that these are the graphics menus which were included also in previous versions of SPSS. The current version also contains a second, new set of menus for the same graphs, under <strong>Graphs / Chart Builder</strong>. We do not regard these as an improvement in usability, so we will continue to use the old menus. You are welcome to explore the cababilities of the âChart Builderâ on your own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Eventually the menu choices lead to a <strong>dialog box</strong> with various boxes and buttons for specifying details of the required analysis. Most dialog boxes contain buttons which open new dialog boxes for further options. The details of these choices for the methods covered on this course are described in the instructions to individual computer classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost all of the dialog boxes have options which are not needed for our classes and never mentioned in the instructions. Some of these simply modify the output, others request variants of the statistical methods which will not be used in these classes. All such options have default values which can be left untouched here. You are, however, welcome to experiment with these additional choices to see what they do. Further information on them can be accessed through the <strong>Help</strong> button in each dialog box.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="notational-conventions-for-the-instructions" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Notational conventions for the instructions</h4>
<p>Because analyses in SPSS are carried out by making choices from the menus, the instructions for the computer classes need to describe these choices somehow. To reduce the length and tedium of the instructions, we will throughout present them in a particular format explained below. Because this information is rather abstract if read in isolation, it is best to go through it while carrying out specific instructions for the first few computer classes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The appropriate menu choices for obtaining the dialog box for the required analysis are first given in bold, for example as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Analyze/Descriptive statistics/Frequencies</strong></p>
<p>This is short for âClick on the menu item <strong>Analyze</strong> at the top of the window; from the drop-down menu, select <strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> and then click on <strong>Frequencies</strong>.â This particular choice opens a dialog box for constructing various descriptive statistics and graphs (as discussed in Chapter <a href="c-descr1.html#c-descr1">3</a>).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, subsequent instructions then refer to choices in the most recently opened dialog box, without repeating the full path to it.</p></li>
<li><p>For all of the statistical analyses, we need first to specify which variables the analyses should be applied to. This is done by entering the names of those variables in appropriate boxes in the dialog boxes. For example, the dialog box opened above has a box labelled <strong>Variable(s)</strong> for this purpose. The dialog box also includes a separate box containing a list of all the variables in the data set. The required variables are selected from this list and moved to the choice boxes (and back again, when choices are changed) by clicking on an arrow button between the boxes. For example, suppose that a data set contains a grouped age variable called <em>AGEGROUP</em>, for which we want to construct a frequency table. The class instructions may then state in words âPlace <em>AGEGROUP</em> in the <strong>Variable(s)</strong> boxâ, or sometimes just</p>
<p><strong>Variable(s)/</strong><em>AGEGROUP</em></p>
<p>both of which are short for âIn the dialog box opened above, click on the name <em>AGEGROUP</em> in the list of variables, and then click on the arrow button to move the name into the <strong>Variable(s)</strong> boxâ. Sometimes we may also use a generic instruction of the form</p>
<p><strong>Variable(s)/</strong><em><span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>Variables<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span></em></p>
<p>where <em><span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>Variables<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span></em> indicates that this is where we would put the name of any variables for which we want to obtain a frequency table. Note that here and in many other procedures, it is possible to select several variables at once. For the Frequencies procedure used as an example here, this simply means that a separate frequency table is constructed for each selected variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Other choices in a dialog box determine details of the analysis and its output. In most cases the selection is made from a fixed list of possibilities provided by SPSS, by clicking on the appropriate box or button. In the instructions, the choice is indicated by listing a path to it, for example as</p>
<p><strong>Charts/Chart Type/Bar charts</strong></p>
<p>in the above example (this requests the so-called bar chart). The items on such a list are labels for various items in the dialog boxes. For example, here <strong>Charts</strong> is a button which opens a new subsidiary dialog box, <strong>Chart Type</strong> is the title of a list of options in this new dialog box, and <strong>Bar charts</strong> is the choice we want to select. In other words, the above instruction is short for âIn the dialog box opened above, click on the button <strong>Charts</strong> to open a new dialog box. Under <strong>Chart type</strong>, select <strong>Bar charts</strong> by clicking on a button next to it.â</p></li>
<li><p>Some choices need to be made by typing in some information rather than selecting from a list of options. Specific instructions for this will be given when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>After choices are made in subsidiary dialog boxes, we return to the main dialog box by clicking on <strong>Continue</strong>. Once all the required choices have been made, the analysis is executed by clicking on <strong>OK</strong> in the main dialog box. This should be reasonably obvious, so we will omit explicit instructions to do so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A useful feature of SPSS is the <strong>dialog recall</strong> button, which is typically sixth from the left in the top row of buttons in the Output viewer window; the button shows a rectangle with a green arrow pointing down from it. Clicking on this gives a menu of recently used procedures, and choosing one of these brings up the relevant dialog box, with the previously used choices selected. This is useful when you want to rerun a procedure, e.g.Â to try different choices for its options. It is usually quicker to reopen a dialog box using the dialog recall button than through the menus.</p>
</div>
<div id="spss-session-options" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>SPSS session options</h4>
<p>Various options for controlling the format of SPSS output and other features can be found under <strong>Edit/Options</strong>. For example, an often useful choice is <strong>General/Variable Lists/Display names</strong>. This instructs SPSS to display the names of variables in the variable lists of all procedures, instead of the (typically much longer) descriptive labels of the variables. In large data sets this may make it easier to find the right variables from the list. This may be further helped by selecting <strong>General/Variable Lists/Alphabetical</strong>, which causes the names to be listed in an alphabetical order rather than the order in which the variables are included in the data set.</p>
</div>
<div id="printing-from-spss" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Printing from SPSS</h4>
<p>All the computers in the public rooms are connected to one of the laser printers. When you print a document or a part of it, you need to have credit on your printing account. See  further information.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can print your results from the Output Viewer either by selecting <strong>File/Print</strong> or by clicking on Print on the toolbar (the button with a little picture of a printer). Please note that SPSS output is often quite long, so this may result in much more printout than you really want.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, in the Output Viewer, select the objects to be printed, select <strong>Edit / Copy</strong>, open a Word or Excel document and <strong>Paste</strong>. You can make any changes or corrections in this document before printing it. This method gives you more control over what gets printed than printing directly from SPSS.</p></li>
<li><p>At the printer terminal, type in your username and password. The files sent for printing are then listed. Select the appropriate file number and follow the instructions given by the computer.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="spss-control-language" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>SPSS control language</h4>
<p>Early versions of SPSS had no menu-based interface. Instead, commands were executed by specifying them in SPSS command language. This language is still there, underlying the menus, and each choice of commands and options from the menus can also be specified in the control language. We will not use this approach on this course, so you can ignore this section if you wish. However, there are some very good reasons why you might want to learn about the control language if you need to work with SPSS for, say, analyses for your thesis or dissertation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because the control language commands can be saved in a file, they preserve a record of how an analysis was done. This may be important for checking that there were no errors, and for rerunning the analyses later if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>For repetitive analyses, modifying and rerunning commands in the control language is quicker and less tedious than using the menus repeatedly.</p></li>
<li><p>Some advanced SPSS procedures are not included in the menus, and can only be accessed through the control language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main cost of using the control language is learning its syntax. This is initially much harder than using the menus, but becomes easier with experience. The easiest way to begin learning the syntax is to request SPSS to print out the commands corresponding to choices made from the menus. Two easy ways of doing so are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Selecting the session option (i.e.Â under <strong>Edit/Options</strong>) <strong>Viewer/Display commands in the log</strong>. This causes the commands corresponding to the menu choices to be displayed in the output window.</p></li>
<li><p>Clicking on the <strong>Paste</strong> button in a dialog box (instead of <strong>OK</strong>) after selecting an analysis. This opens a <em>Syntax window</em> where the corresponding commands are now displayed. The commands in a syntax window can be edited and executed, and also saved in a file (with the extension <strong>.sps</strong>) for future use.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> WEEK 2 class: Descriptive statistics for categorical data, and entering data</h2>
<div id="data-set" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Data set</h4>
<p>The data file <strong>ESS5_sample.sav</strong> will be used today. It contains a simplified sample of data from UK respondents in the 2010 European Social Survey (Round 5). The questions in the survey that you see here were designed By Dr Jonathan Jackson and his team as part of a module investigating public trust in the criminal justice system. Further information about the study can be found at<br />
<code>www.lse.ac.uk/methodology/whosWho/Jackson/jackson_ESS.aspx</code><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The main purpose of todayâs class is to introduce you to the layout of SPSS and to show you how to produce some basic tables and graphs for categorical variables. Additionally, we provide instructions on how to enter data into a new SPSS data file, using the Data Editor. This exercise is not strictly needed for the course, but we include it for two purposes. Firstly, students often find this a helpful way of learning how the software works. Secondly, this exercise may be a useful introduction for students who go on to collect or collate data for their own empirical research.</p>

<div id="part-1-the-layout-of-an-spss-data-file" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Part 1: The layout of an SPSS data file</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Opening an SPSS data file</strong>: this is done from <strong>File/Open/Data</strong>, selecting the required file from whichever folder it is saved in in the usual Windows way. Do this to open ESS5_sample.sav.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information in the Variable View window.</strong> The data file is now displayed in the Data Editor. Its Data View window shows the data as a spreadsheet (i.e.Â a data matrix). We will first consider the information in the Variable View window, accessed by clicking on the Variable View tab at the bottom left corner of the window. The columns of this window show various pieces of information about the variables. Take a little while familiarising yourself with them. The most important of the columns in Variable View are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Name</strong> of the variable in the SPSS data file. The names in this column (also shown as the column headings in Data View) will be used to refer to specific variables in all of the instructions for these computer classes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type</strong> of the variable. Here most of the variables are <em>Numeric</em>, i.e.Â numbers, and a few are <em>String</em>, which means text. Clicking on the entry for a variable in this column and then on the button (with three dots on it) revealed by this shows a list of other possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Width</strong> and <strong>Decimals</strong> control the total number of digits and the number of decimal places displayed in Data View. Clicking on an entry in these columns reveals buttons which can be used to increase or decrease these values. Here all but two of the numeric variables are coded as whole numbers, so Decimals has been set to 0 for them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Label</strong> is used to enter a longer description of the variable. Double-clicking on an entry allows you to edit the text.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Values</strong> shows labels for individual values of a variable. This is mostly relevant for categorical variables, such as most of the ones in these data. Such variables are coded in the data set as numbers, and the Values entry maintains a record of the meanings of the categories the numbers correspond to. You can see examples of this by clicking on some of the entries in the Values column and then on the resulting button. The value labels can also be displayed for each observation in Data View by selecting <strong>View/Value Labels</strong> in that window.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing</strong> specifies <em>missing data codes</em>, i.e.Â values which are not actual measurements but indicators that an observation should be treated as missing. There may be several such codes. For example, variables in these data often have separate missing data codes for cases where a respondent was never asked a question (âNot applicableâ, often abbreviated NAP), replied âDonât knowâ (DK) or otherwise failed to provide an answer (âRefusalâ or âNo answerâ; NA); the explanations of these values are found in the Values column. An alternative to using missing data codes (so-called <em>User missing</em> values) is to enter no value (a <em>System missing</em> value) for an observation in the data matrix. This is displayed as a full stop (.) in Data View. There are no such values in these data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Measure</strong> indicates the measurement level of a variable, as <em>Nominal</em>, <em>Ordinal</em> or <em>Scale</em> (meaning interval). This is mostly for the userâs information, as SPSS makes little use of this specification.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Any changes made to the data file are preserved by saving it again from <strong>File/Save</strong> (or by clicking on the Save File button of the toolbar, which the one with the picture of a diskette). You will also be prompted to do so when exiting SPSS or when trying to open a new data file. Today you should not save any changes you may have made to ESS5_sample.sav, so click <strong>No</strong> if prompted to do so below.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="part-2-descriptive-statistics-for-categorical-variables" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Part 2: Descriptive statistics for categorical variables</h4>
<p>Most of the statistics required for this class are found in SPSS under <strong>Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies</strong> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Names of the variables for which the statistics are requested are placed in the <strong>Variable(s)</strong> box. To make it easy to find variables in the list box on the left, you may find it convenient to change the way the variables are displayed in the list; see under âSPSS Session Options in Section <a href="c-class0.html#s-intro-SPSS">7.2</a> for instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Tables of frequencies: select <strong>Display frequency tables</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Bar charts: <strong>Charts/Chart Type/Bar charts</strong>. Note that under <strong>Chart Values</strong> you can choose between frequencies or percentage labels on the vertical axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Pie charts: <strong>Charts/Chart Type/Pie charts</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we will construct some two-way tables or cross-tabulations, by selecting <strong>Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Crosstabs</strong>. In the dialog box that opens, request a contingency table between two variables by entering</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The name of the row variable into the <strong>Row(s)</strong> box, and</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the column variable into the <strong>Column(s)</strong> box.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cells/Percentages</strong> for percentages within the table: <strong>Row</strong> gives percentages within each row (i.e.Â frequencies divided by row totals), <strong>Column</strong> percentages within columns, and <strong>Total</strong> percentages out of the total sample size.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The labels in the SPSS output should be self-explanatory. Note that in this and all subsequent classes, the output may also include some entries corresponding to methods and statistics not discussed on this course. They can be ignored here.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The first variable in the data set, GOODJOB, asks respondents whether they generally feel that the police are doing a good job in their country. There are three response categories for this item: âa good jobâ, âneither a good job nor a bad jobâ, or âa bad jobâ. Obtain a frequency table and bar chart to investigate the distribution of responses to this question.</p>
<p>Check that you understand how to interpret the output you obtain. In particular, make sure that you understand the information displayed in each of the columns in the main table, and that you can see the connection between the information in the table and the information represented in the bar chart.</p></li>
<li><p>The last variable in the set, AGE_GRP, records in which of the following age groups each respondent falls: up to 29 years of age, 30-49, or 50+ years. Let us consider the association between age group and opinions of the police. Obtain a two-way contingency table of GOODJOB by AGE_GRP. To make interpretation easier, request percentages within each of the age groups. If you use AGE_GRP as the row variable, then include row percentages in the output.</p>
<p>Interpret the resulting table. Are opinions of the police distributed differently among the three different age groups? Does there appear to be an association between age group and attitude?</p></li>
<li><p>If you have time after completing the data entry exercise (below), you may wish to return to this data set and explore frequencies and contingency tables for some of the other variables in the set.</p></li>

<div id="part-3-entering-data-directly-into-data-editor" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Part 3: Entering data directly into Data Editor</h4>
<p>This procedure may be useful to know if the data you are analysing are not in any electronic form at the beginning of the analysis, for example if you start with a pile of filled-in questionnaires from a survey. For practice, we will enter the following small, artificial data set:</p>
<p>Sex: Man; Age: 45; Weight: 11 st 3 lbs<br />
Sex: Woman; Age: 68; Weight: 8 st 2 lbs<br />
Sex: Woman; Age: 17; Weight: 9 st 6 lbs<br />
Sex: Man; Age: 28; Weight: 13 st 8 lbs<br />
Sex: Woman; Age: 16; Weight: 7 st 8lbs</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Select <strong>File/New/Data</strong> to clear the Data Editor. Go to Variable View and enter into the first four rows of the Name column names for the variables, for example <em>sex</em>, <em>age</em>, <em>wstones</em> and <em>wpounds</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to Data View and type the data above into the appropriate columns, one unit (respondent) per row. Note that the personâs weight is entered into two columns, one for stones and one for pounds. Enter sex using numerical codes, e.g.Â 1 for women and 2 for men.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the file as a new SPSS data file (<strong>File/Save as</strong>), giving it a name of your choice. You should also resave the file (from <strong>File/Save</strong> or by clicking the File Save button) after each of the changes made below.</p></li>
<li><p>Practise modifying the information in Variable View by adding the following information for the sex variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enter the label <em>Sex of the respondent</em> into the Label column.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the Values cell and then on the resulting button to open a dialog box for entering value labels. Enter <strong>Value:</strong> <em>1</em>; <strong>Value Label</strong>: <em>Woman</em>; <strong>Add</strong>. Repeat for men, and click <strong>OK</strong> when finished.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Transforming variables</strong>: It is often necessary to derive new variables from existing ones. We will practise the two most common examples of this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Creating a grouped variable</strong>: Suppose, for example, that we want to define a grouped age variable with three categories: less than 25 years, 25â54 and 55 or over. This is done as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select <strong>Transform/Recode into Different Variables</strong>. This opens a dialog box which is used to define the rule for how values of the existing variable are to be grouped into categories of the new one.</p></li>
<li><p>Move the name of the age variable to the <strong>Input Variable â<span class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span> Output Variable</strong> box.</p></li>
<li><p>Under <strong>Output Variable</strong>, enter the <strong>Name</strong> of the new variable, for example <em>agegroup</em>, and click <strong>Change</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on <strong>Old and New Values</strong>. Enter <strong>Old Value/Range: Lowest through</strong> <em>24</em> and <strong>New Value/Value:</strong> <em>1</em>, and click <strong>Add</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat for the other two categories, selecting <strong>Range:</strong> <em>25</em> <strong>through</strong> <strong>54</strong> and <strong>Range:</strong> <em>55</em> <strong>through highest</strong> for <strong>Old value</strong>, and <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> respectively for <strong>New value</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You should now see the correct grouping instructions in the <strong>Old â<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{&gt;}\)</span> New</strong> box. Click <strong>Continue</strong> and <strong>OK</strong> to create the new variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the new variable in Data View. At this stage you should normally enter in Variable View the value labels of the age groups.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculations on variables</strong>: Some new variables are obtained through mathematical calculations on existing ones. For example, suppose we want to include weight in kilograms as well as stones and pounds. Using the information that one stone is equal to 6.35Â kg and one pound is about 0.45Â kg, the transformation is carried out as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select <strong>Transform/Compute Variable</strong>. This opens a dialog box which is used to define the rule for calculating the values of the new variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter <strong>Target variable:</strong> <em>weightkg</em> (for example; this is the name of the new variable) and <strong>Numeric Expression:</strong> <em>6.35 * wstones + 0.45 * wpounds</em>; for the latter, you can either type in the formula or use the variable list and calculator buttons in a fairly obvious way.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h4>Descriptive statistics in SPSS</h4>
<p>This week you will produce and examine descriptive statistics for a number of individual variables. As for last week, almost all of the statistics required for this class can be obtained in SPSS under <strong>Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies</strong>. Note that you will probably not find the tables of frequencies very useful, because continuous variables can take so many different values. So for this class, uncheck the <strong>Display frequency tables</strong> option in the dialog box.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Measures of central tendency: <strong>Mean</strong>, <strong>Median</strong> and <strong>Mode</strong> under <strong>Statistics / Central Tendency</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Measures of variation: <strong>Range</strong>, <strong>Std.Â deviation</strong> and <strong>Variance</strong> under <strong>Statistics/Dispersion</strong>. For the Interquartile range, select <strong>Statistics/ Percentile values/Quartiles</strong> and calculate by hand the difference between the third and first quartiles given (as Percentiles 75 and 25 respectively) in the output.</p></li>
<li><p>Histograms: <strong>Charts/Chart Type/Histograms</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two charts needed today are not found under the Frequencies procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stem and leaf plots</strong>, which are obtained from <strong>Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Explore</strong> by entering variable(s) under <strong>Dependent list</strong> and selecting <strong>Display/Plots</strong> and <strong>Plots/Descriptive/Stem-and-leaf</strong>. You can place more than one variable under the <strong>Dependent list</strong> in order to compare variables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Box plots</strong> are also automatically generated through this dialog box, regardless of whether you want to see them! So this is the simplest way to produce them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these statistics and charts can be obtained in other ways as well, for example from <strong>Analyze/ Descriptive Statistics/Descriptives</strong> or <strong>Graphs/Legacy Dialogs/Histogram</strong>, or <strong>Graphs/Legacy Dialogs/Boxplot</strong>, but we will not use these alternatives today. Feel free to investigate them in your own time if you wish.</p>
<p>The labels in the SPSS output should be self-explanatory. Note that in this and all subsequent classes, the output may also include some entries corresponding to methods and statistics not discussed on this course. They can be ignored here.</p>

<div id="classwork-1" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Classwork</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The variable <em>YOUTH_DEPRIVATION</em> records for each borough the percentage of children who live in out-of-work families. This is an indicator of deprivation, with higher values indicating a worse situation for each borough. Investigate the distribution of this variable across London boroughs by obtaining its mean, median, minimum and maximum, quartiles and standard deviation, and a histogram. Obtain also a stem and leaf plot and a box plot. Note that double-clicking on a histogram (or any other SPSS graph) opens it in a new window, where the graph can be further edited by changing titles, colours etc. The graph can also be exported from SPSS into other software. Check that you understand how to find the measures of central tendency and dispersion from the output. Does the distribution of YOUTH_DEPRIVATION appear to be symmetrically distributed or skewed?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider now the variable <em>CRIME</em>, which records the numbers of reported crimes for every 1000 inhabitants, over the years 2011-12. Obtain some summary descriptive statistics, a histogram and a box plot for this variable. Is the distribution of the variable symmetric or skewed to the left or right? <em>CRIME</em> is one of many variables in this data set which have outliers, i.e.Â boroughs with unusually large or small values of the variable. Normally statistical analysis focuses on the whole data rather than individual observations, but the identities of individual outliers are often also of interest. The outliers can be seen most easily in the box plots, where SPSS labels them with their case numbers, so that you can identify them easily in the data set. For example, 1 would indicate the 1st case in the data set. If you click on to the Data View you can see that this 1st case is the City of London. Which borough is the outlier for CRIME?</p></li>

Is the distribution of voter turnout symmetrical or skewed? How you can you tell?</p></li>
<li><p>In the data set employment rates are given overall, but also separately for males and females. The employment rate is the percentage of working age population who are in employment. Compare and contrast male and female employment rates across the boroughs, using the variables <em>MALE_EMPLOYMENT</em> and <em>FEMALE_EMPLOYMENT</em>.

<p><strong>Inference on proportions in SPSS</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><p>It is probably easiest to use a pocket calculator for the calculations, and this is the approach we recommend for this class. The only part of the analysis it cannot do is calculating the precise <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value for the tests, but even this can be avoided by using critical values from a statistical table such as the one at the end of this Coursepack to determine approximate <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-values (or by using an online <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value calculator â see âAbout Week 4 classâ on the Moodle page for suggested links).</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="classwork-3" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Classwork</h4>
<p>The survey data set <em>BES2010post_lastdebate.sav</em> contains part of the information collected by the British Election Study, an ongoing research programme designed to understand voter choices in the UK.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In the run-up to the UK General Election on 6 May 2010, opinion polls reported quite dramatic changes in popularity of the Liberal Democrat party. Key to their increasing popularity was the performance of their party leader, Nick Clegg, in a series of three televised debates between the leaders of the three main political parties (the other participants were Gordon Brown for Labour and David Cameron for the Conservative party). The debates were broadcast between 15 and 29 April 2010.</p>
<p>The data in <em>BES2010post_lastdebate.sav</em> contain information on respondentsâ voting intentions, obtained after the debates had ended (i.e.Â between 30 April and 6 May).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>VOTE_LIBDEM</em> is a dichotomous variable indicating whether a respondent intended to vote for the Liberal Democrats (value 1) or some other party (0) in the 2010 General Election. The value of this variable is by definition missing for those who had not decided which way they would vote or who did not intend to vote at all, so they are automatically excluded from the analysis. The parameter of interest <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is now the population proportion of those who <em>say</em> they would vote Liberal Democrat. We will compare it to 0.23, the proportion of the vote the party actually received in 2010. The analysis is thus one-sample inference on a population proportion, and the relevant formulas are (<a href="#ztestp"><strong>??</strong></a>) for the test statistic and (<a href="#cip2"><strong>??</strong></a>) for the confidence interval.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Begin by creating a frequency table of <em>VOTE_LIBDEM</em>. This should show that the sample estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is 0.260, out of <span class="math inline">\(3226\)</span> non-missing responses. Thus <span class="math inline">\(n=3226\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}=0.260\)</span> in the notation of Chapter <a href="#c-probs"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>For the one-sample significance test, the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> under the null hypothesis is <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}=0.230\)</span>. Using equation (<a href="#ztestp"><strong>??</strong></a>), the value of the test statistic <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is thus given by the calculation <span class="math display">\[z = \frac{0.260-0.230}{\sqrt{0.230\times (1-0.230)/3226}}\]</span> Calculate this using a calculator. The result should be <span class="math inline">\(z=4.049\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The (two-sided) <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value for this is the probability that a value from the standard normal distribution is at most <span class="math inline">\(-4.049\)</span> or at least 4.049. Evaluate this approximately by comparing the value of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to critical values from the standard normal distribution (c.f.Â Table <a href="#tab:t-ttable"><strong>??</strong></a>) as explained in Section <a href="#ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd"><strong>??</strong></a>. Here, for example, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is larger than 1.96, so the two-sided <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value must be smaller than 0.05. Convince yourself that you understand this statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of prospective Liberal Democrat voters, using equation (<a href="#cip2"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you conclude about the proportions of prospective and actual Liberal Democrat voters? Why might the two differ from each other?</p></li>
<li><p>The variable <em>TVDEBATE</em> indicates whether the respondent reports having watched any of the three televised debates (1 for Yes, at least one watched, 0 otherwise - this includes ânoâ and âdonât knowâ responses). We will compare the proportion of people intending to vote Liberal Democrat amongst those who watched some or all of the debates with those who did not, using the two-sample methods of analysis discussed in Section <a href="c-samples.html#s-probs-2samples">4.2</a>. The formula of the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test statistic for testing the hypothesis of equal population proportions is thus (<a href="#ztestDpi"><strong>??</strong></a>), and a confidence interval for the difference of the porportions is (<a href="#ciDpi"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Begin by calculating the relevant sample proportions. The easiest way to do this is by creating a two-way contingency table between <em>TVDEBATE</em> and <em>VOTE_LIBDEM</em> as you did in the Week 2 and 4 classes. The results required for the analysis considered here are all shown in the resulting table. Convince yourself that these show that, in the notation of Section <a href="c-samples.html#s-probs-2samples">4.2</a>,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_{1}=930\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}_{1}=0.218\; (=203/930)\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_{2}=2296\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}_{2}=0.277\; (=636/2296)\)</span>,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>where 1 denotes respondents who did not watch any of the debates and 2 those who watched at least some. The pooled estimated proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}\)</span> (formula <a href="#phat2sample"><strong>??</strong></a>) used in the test statistic (<a href="#ztestDpi"><strong>??</strong></a>) is here <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}=0.260\)</span>, shown on the âTotalâ row.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the test statistic, its <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value and a 95% confidence for the difference in population proportions, using the relevant formulas. For example, the test statistic is here given by <span class="math display">\[z= \frac{0.277-0.218}{\sqrt{0.260\times (1-0.260)\times
(1/2296+1/930)}}.\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you conclude? Is there evidence that those who watched at least some of the leadersâ debates were more likely to declare an intention to vote Liberal Democrat? If there is, how big is the difference in proportions of prospective Liberal Democrat voters between the debate-watchers and debate-non-watchers?</p></li>

<p>Decathlon is a sport where the participants complete ten different athletics events over two days. Their results in each are then translated into points, and the winner is the competitor with the highest points total for the ten events. The file <em>decathlon2012.sav</em> contains the results of the decathlon competition at the 2012 Olympics in London for the 26 athletes who finished the competition.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The results for each event are given both in their original units (variables with names beginning with âmark_â) and in decathlon points (names beginning with âpoints_â). The ten events are identified by the variable labels in Variable View. The variable <em>points_total</em> gives the final points total for each competitor.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a scatterplot between the result (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>-axis) and points (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>-axis) for one event, the 100-metre sprint (variables <em>MARK_100M</em> and <em>POINTS_100M</em>), and add a fitted line. This simply provides information on the calculation used to transform the result into points. Clearly a linear calculation is used for this, at least over the range of results in these data. Notice the downward slope of the line: the faster the result, the higher the number of points. From now on, for simplicity we will consider only the points variables for each event.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the correlation matrix for all pairs of variables among the ten individual points scores and the total score. Consider first correlations between the individual events only. Which correlations tend to be high (say over 0.5), which ones close to zero and which ones even negative? Can you think of any reasons for this? Draw scatterplots and fitted lines for a few pairs of variables with different sizes of correlations (here the variables are treated symmetrically, so it does not matter which one is placed on the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>-axis). Can these associations be reasonably described as linear?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider now the correlations between the ten event scores and the final score <em>POINTS_TOTAL</em>. Which of them is highest, and which one lowest? Examine the scatterplot and fitted line between points for 100 metres (<em>POINTS_100M</em>) and the total score (POINTS_TOTAL). Fit a line to this scatterplot variables, with <em>POINTS_100M</em> as the explanatory variable. Interpret the results. Does there appear to be an association between the points for 100 metres and the total score? What is the nature of the association?</p>
<p>Suppose you were told that a competitor received 800 points (a time of about 11.3 seconds) for 100 metres, the first event of the decathlon. Based on the fitted model, what final points score would you predict for him? You can calculate this fitted value with a pocket calculator.

<p>Three-way contingency tables are again obtained from <strong>Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Crosstabs</strong>. The only change from Week 4 class is that the conditioning variable is now placed in the <strong>Layer 1 of 1</strong> box. This produces a series of partial two-way tables between the row and column variables specified in the <strong>Row(s)</strong> and <strong>Column(s)</strong> boxes, one for each category of the <strong>Layer</strong> variable. Percentages and <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> test are similarly calculated separately for each partial table. For this example we elaborate on the first two exercises from Week 4 class. To remind you, the categorical variables we are analysing are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The respondentâs sex, recorded as the variable <em>SEX</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>age as <em>AGEGROUP</em> in three groups: 18-34, 35-54 and 55 or over.</p></li>
<li><p><em>FEFAM</em>: Level of agreement with the following statement: âIt is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and familyâ, with response options Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, and Strongly disagree.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First remind yourself of the associations between SEX and FEFAM and between AGEGROUP and FEFAM. Obtain the two-way contingency table between <em>FEFAM</em> and <em>SEX</em>, including appropriate percentages and <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> test of independence. Repeat the procedure for <em>FEFAM</em> by <em>AGEGROUP</em>. What do you learn about the associations between attitude and sex, and between attitude and age?</p></li>
<li><p>Sociologists would suggest that the relationship between sex and attitude towards male and female work roles might be different for different age groups. In other words, age might modify the association between sex and attitude. Investigate this possible interaction between the three variables. Create a three-way table where <em>FEFAM</em> is the column variable, <em>SEX</em> the row variable and <em>AGEGROUP</em> the layer (conditioning) variable. Study the SPSS output, and make sure you understand how this shows three partial tables of <em>FEFAM</em> vs.<em>SEX</em>, one for each possible value of <em>AGEGROUP</em>. Examine and interpret the associations in the three partial tables. State the results of the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> test for each partial table, and illustrate your interpretations with some appropriate percentages. Finally, summarise your findings: are there differences in the nature, strength or significance of the association between sex and attitude, depending on the age group? Comment on how this interpretation differs from the initial two-way table of <em>FEFAM</em> and <em>SEX</em>.</p></li>

<div id="multiple-linear-regression-in-spss" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Multiple linear regression in SPSS</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Multiple linear regression is obtained from <strong>Analyze/Regression/Linear</strong>, by placing all of the required explanatory variables in the <strong>Independent(s)</strong> box. No other changes from last week are required.</p></li>
<li><p>To include categorical explanatory variables, the necessary dummy variables have to be created first. The ones for todayâs class are already included in the data set. If you need to create dummy variables for your own analyses in the future, it is usually easiest to do so from <strong>Transform/Compute Variable</strong>. Some of the buttons on the keypad shown in that dialog box are <em>logical operators</em> for defining conditions for which the outcome is either 1 (True) or 0 (False), as required by a dummy variable. For example, the categorical variable <em>INCOME_GROUP</em> in todayâs data set has the value 3 if the country is in the high income group. The dummy variable <em>HIGH_INCOME</em> was created from this by entering <strong>Target Variable:</strong> <em>HIGH_INCOME</em> and <strong>Numeric Expression:</strong> <em>INCOME_GROUP=3</em>. This means that the new variable <em>HIGH_INCOME</em> will have the value 1 for countries for which <em>INCOME_GROUP</em> is equal to 3, and will be 0 otherwise. Other logical operators may also be used: for example, <em>urban_pop$&lt;$50</em> would produce 1 if the variable <em>URBAN_POP</em> was less than 50 and 0 otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="classwork-5" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Classwork</h4>
<p>The file <em>humandevelopment2011.sav</em> contains data on a number of indicators of what might broadly be called development, for 194 countries in 2011. These were collated from two international data agency sources<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>. The response variable considered today is <em>SCHOOL_YEARS</em>, which records for each country the mean number of years of schooling taken by the adult population. We treat it here as a general indicator of the educational situation in a country, which is an important aspect of development. We will consider the following explanatory variables for it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>URBAN_POP</em>: the degree of urbanisation of the country, specifically the percentage of the countryâs population living in urban areas variable</p></li>
<li><p><em>GOVERNANCE</em>, a continuous variable contructed from expert opinion surveys to reflect the perceived effectiveness of government in delivering services.</p></li>
<li><p><em>INFANT_MORTALITY</em>, number of infants dying before 1 year old, per 1,000 live births â a âproxyâ indicator representing the health of the population</p></li>
<li><p><em>INCOME_GROUP</em>, classified as low, middle or high income economies. This is also provided in the form of three dummy variables: <em>LOW_INCOME</em>, <em>MIDDLE_INCOME</em> and <em>HIGH_INCOME</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Obtain some descriptive statistics for the continuous variables, to gain and impression of their ranges. A quick way of doing this is via <strong>Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies</strong>, unchecking the âDisplay frequency tablesâ and requesting minimum and maximum values.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate the idea that increased urbanisation is linked to greater availability of schooling for people. Obtain a scatterplot and a simple linear regression model for <em>SCHOOL_YEARS</em> given <em>URBAN_POP</em>. What do you observe in the scatterplot? Interpret the regression output.</p></li>
<li><p>Now consider the possibility that schooling may also be explained by the effectiveness of governments in providing public services (such as education). Fit a multiple linear regression model for <em>SCHOOL_YEARS</em> given both <em>URBAN_POP</em> and <em>GOVERNANCE</em>. Compare the the estimated coefficient of <em>URBAN_POP</em> for this model with the coefficient of the same variable in the model in Question 2. What do you conclude? Does the association between schooling and urbanisation change when we control for government effectiveness? If so, in what way? Interpret the estimate coefficient of <em>GOVERNANCE</em> in the fitted model, the results of its <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test and its 95% confidence interval.</p></li>
<li><p>Next consider the possible explanatory value of the income wealth of a country for understanding variation in schooling years. Include income by entering two of the three dummy variables for income group. For the most convenient interpretation, we suggest that you leave âlow incomeâ as the reference group, and enter the dummies for <em>MIDDLE_INCOME</em> and <em>HIGH_INCOME</em> in the model. Interpret the values of the estimated regression coefficients for the two income dummy variables. In addition, for each one state the null hypothesis for its <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test, and interpret the result of the test and 95% confidence intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Using this model, what level of schooling would you predict for a country with 70% urban population, a score of 1.5 on governance, and a high income economy?</p></li>
<li><p>Using this model, what level of schooling would you predict for a country with 30% urban population, a score of -0.2 on governance, and a low income economy?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HOMEWORK</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Write up your answers to the last three questions in the class exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, consider one more possible explanatory variable: <em>INFANT_MORTALITY</em>. Add this variable to the multiple linear regression model fitted above. Is it statistically significant, at the 1% level of significance? Interpret the value of its estimated coefficient, and its 95% confidence interval. Take care to make sense of the sign (positive or negative) of the coefficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Has the inclusion of <em>INFANT_MORTALITY</em> modified the interpretation of any of the other explanatory variables in the model? Are they all statistically significant, at the 5% level of significance? Briefly outline the similarities and differences between the results for this final model and the model fitted in the class exercise.</p></li>

<div id="week-10-class-review-and-multiple-linear-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.11</span> WEEK 10 class: Review and Multiple linear regression</h2>
<p><strong>Data set</strong>: File <strong>ESS5GB_trust.sav</strong>.</p>
<p>This class is for you to revisit any topics of your choosing. Make the most of the opportunity to ask your class teachers any questions you have about any of the course material, and to practise any of the analyses you have learned during the course.</p>
<p>As an optional exercise, the data file <strong>ESS5GB_trust.sav</strong> is provided. This contains a selection of variables from the survey of British respondents that forms the 2010 wave of the European Social Survey<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use the data to practise multiple linear regression modelling on one or more of the variables capturing peopleâs levels of trust in institutions. For these questions, respondents were asked the following: âUsing this card, please tell me on a score of 0-10 how much you personally trust each of the institutions I read out. 0 means you do not trust an institution at all, and 10 means you have complete trust.â The institutions (and their variable names) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>trstprl</em>: Trust in countryâs parliament</p></li>
<li><p><em>trstlgl</em>: Trust in the legal system</p></li>
<li><p><em>trstplc</em>: Trust in the police</p></li>
<li><p><em>trstplt</em>: Trust in politicians</p></li>
<li><p><em>trstprt</em>: Trust in political parties</p></li>
<li><p><em>trstep</em>: Trust in the European Parliament</p></li>
<li><p><em>trstun</em>: Trust in the United Nations</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After you choose a response variable that interests you, you will need to select some potential explanatory variables to test. The data set contains a number of variables. Some are socio-demographic, such as age and gender. Some are attitudinal or behavioural, such as amount of time spent reading newspapers. You will need to make a judgement about the levels of measurement of the variables, and how to enter them into the model. Use the âValuesâ column in the SPSS Variable View to check how each variable is coded. Note: we suggest that it is not too much of a compromise to treat the variables on television, radio and newspaper consumption as continuous, interval level variables. Note also: we have provided dummy variables for the categorical variables in the data set.</p>
<p><strong>HOMEWORK</strong></p>
<p>As this is the last week of the course, there is no homework. You can find further information on this and the other class exercises and homeworks in the model answers, which will be posted in the Moodle site.</p>
