# Continuous variables: Population and sampling distributions {#c-contd}

## Introduction {#s-contd-intro}

*This* chapter serves both as an explanation of some topics that were
skimmed over previously, and as preparation for later chapters. Its
central theme is probability distributions of continuous variables.
These may appear in two distinct roles:

-   As population distributions of continuous variables, for instance
    blood pressure in the illustrative example of this chapter. This
    contrasts with the kinds of discrete variables that were considered
    in Chapters \@ref(c-tables) and \@ref(c-probs). Methods of inference
    for continuous variables will be introduced in Chapters
    \@ref(c-means) and \@ref(c-regression).

-   As sampling distributions of sample statistics. These are typically
    continuous even in analyses of discrete variables, such as in
    Chapter \@ref(c-probs) where the variable of interest $Y$ was binary
    but the sampling distributions of a sample proportion $\hat{\pi}$
    and the $z$-test statistic for population probability $\pi$ were
    nevertheless continuous. We have already encountered two continuous
    distributions in this role, the $\chi^{2}$ distributions in Chapter
    \@ref(c-tables) and the standard normal distribution in Chapter
    \@ref(c-probs). Their origins are explained in more detail below.

To illustrate the concepts, we use data from the
Health Survey for England 2002 (HES).^[Carried out on behalf of The Department of Health by SCPR and the
Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL. Data used here
were obtained from the UK Data Archive at <http://www.data-archive.ac.uk>.] One part of the survey was a
short physical examination by a nurse. Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1) shows a
histogram and frequency polygon of diastolic blood pressure (in mm Hg)
for 4489 respondents, measured by the mean of the last two of three
measurements taken during the examination. Data from respondents for
whom the measurements were not obtained or were considered invalid have
been excluded. Respondents aged under 25 have also been excluded for
simplicity, because this age group was oversampled in the 2002 HES.

The respondents whose blood pressures are summarized in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bp1) are in reality a sample from a larger population in the
sense of Sections \@ref(s-samples-finpops) and \@ref(s-samples-samples).
However, for illustrative purposes we will here pretend that they are
actually an entire finite population of 4489 people (the adults in a
small town, say). The values summarised in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1) then form
the population distribution of blood pressure in this population. It is
clear that blood pressure is best treated as a continuous variable.

## Population distributions of continuous variables {#s-contd-popdistrs}

### Population parameters and their point estimates {#ss-contd-popdistrs-params}

If we knew all of its values, we could summarise a finite population
distribution by, say, a histogram like Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1). We can also
consider specific characteristics of the distribution, i.e. its
*parameters* in the sense introduced in Section
\@ref(s-probs-distribution). For the distribution of a continuous
variable, the most important parameters are the **population mean**
\begin{equation}
\mu=\frac{\sum Y_{i}}{N}
(\#eq:mu)
\end{equation}
 and the **population variance**
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N}
(\#eq:sigma2)
\end{equation}
 or, instead of the variance, the **population standard
deviation**
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N}}.
(\#eq:sigma)
\end{equation}
 Here $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the lower-case Greek letters
“mu” and “sigma” respectively, and $\sigma^{2}$ is read “sigma squared”.
It is common to use Greek letters for population parameters, as we did
also for the probability parameter $\pi$ in Chapter \@ref(c-probs).

In (\@ref(eq:mu))–(\@ref(eq:sigma)), $N$ is the number of units in a finite
population and the sums indicated by $\Sigma$ are over all of these $N$
units. If we treat the data in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1) as a population,
$N=4489$ and these population parameters are $\mu=74.2$,
$\sigma^{2}=127.87$ and $\sigma=11.3$.

Because the formulas (\@ref(eq:mu))–(\@ref(eq:sigma)) involve the population
size $N$, they apply in this exact form only to finite populations like
the one in this example (and as discussed more generally in Section
\@ref(s-samples-finpops)) but not to infinite ones of the kind discussed
in Section \@ref(s-samples-infpops). However, the definitions of $\mu$,
$\sigma^{2}$, $\sigma$ and other parameters can be extended to apply
also to infinite populations. These definitions, which will be omitted
here, involve the concept of continuous probability distributions that
is discussed in the next section. The interpretations of the population
parameters turn out to be intuitively similar for both the finite and
infinite-population cases, and the same methods of analysis apply to
both, so we can here ignore the distinction without further comment.

The population formulas (\@ref(eq:mu))–(\@ref(eq:sigma)) clearly resemble those
of some sample statistics introduced in Chapter \@ref(c-descr1),
specifically the *sample* mean, variance and standard deviation
\begin{equation}
\bar{Y}=\frac{\sum Y_{i}}{n}, 
(\#eq:Ybar-ch6)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
s^{2} = \frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}{n-1}
(\#eq:s2-ch6)
\end{equation}
<center>and</center>
\begin{equation}
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}{n-1}}
(\#eq:s-ch6)
\end{equation}

where the sums are now over the $n$
observations in a sample. These can be used as descriptions of the
sample distribution as discussed in Chapter \@ref(c-descr1), but also as
*point estimates* of the corresponding population parameters in the
sense defined in Section \@ref(s-probs-pointest). We may thus use the
sample mean $\bar{Y}$ as a point estimate of the population mean $\mu$,
and the sample variance $s^{2}$ and sample standard deviation $s$ as
point estimates of population variance $\sigma^{2}$ and standard
deviation $\sigma$ respectively. These same estimates can be used for
both finite and infinite population distributions.

For further illustration of the connection between population and sample
quantities, we have also drawn a simple random sample of $n=50$
observations from the finite population of $N=4489$ observations in
Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1). Table \@ref(tab:t-bp-example) shows the summary
statistics (\@ref(eq:Ybar-ch6)–(\@ref(eq:s-ch6)) in this sample and the
corresponding parameters (\@ref(eq:mu))–(\@ref(eq:sigma)) in the population.

  \@ref(s-contd-popdistrs)–\@ref(s-contd-clt).

You may have noticed that the formulas of the sample variance
(\@ref(eq:s2-ch6)) and sample standard deviation (\@ref(eq:s-ch6)) involve the
divisor $n-1$ rather than the $n$ which might seem more natural, while
the population formulas (\@ref(eq:sigma2)) and (\@ref(eq:sigma)) do use $N$
rather than $N-1$. The reason for this is that using $n-1$ gives the
estimators certain mathematically desirable properties ($s^{2}$ is an
*unbiased* estimate of $\sigma^{2}$, but $\hat{\sigma}^{2}$ below is
not). This detail need not concern us here. In fact, the statistics
which use $n$ instead,
i.e.
\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\sum (Y_{i}-\bar{Y})^{2}}{n}
(\#eq:s2b)
\end{equation}
 for $\sigma^{2}$ and
$\hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^{2}}$ for $\sigma$, are also sensible
estimates and very similar to $s^{2}$ and $s$ unless $n$ is very small.
In general, there are often several possible sample statistics which
could be used as estimates for the same population parameter.

## Probability distributions of continuous variables {#s-contd-probdistrs}

### General comments {#ss-contd-probdistrs-general}

Thinking about population distributions of continuous distributions
using, say, histograms as in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1) would present
difficulties for statistical inference, for at least two reasons. First,
samples cannot in practice give us enough information to make reliable
inferences on all the details of a population distribution, such as the
small kinks and bumps of Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1). Such details would
typically not even be particularly interesting compared to major
features like the central tendency and variation of the population
distribution. Second, this way of thinking about the population
distribution is not appropriate when the population is regarded as
infinite.

Addressing both of these problems requires one more conceptual leap.
This is to make the assumption that the population distribution is
well-represented by a continuous *probability distribution*, and focus
on inference on the parameters of that distribution.

We have already introduced the concept of probability distributions in
Section \@ref(s-samples-popdistrs), and considered instances of it in
Chapters \@ref(c-tables) and \@ref(c-probs). There, however, the term was
not emphasised because it added no crucial insight into the methods of
inference. This was because for discrete variables a probability
distribution is specified simply by listing the probabilities of all the
categories of the variable. The additional terminology of probability
distributions and their parameters seems almost redundant in that
context.

The situation is very different for continuous variables. This is
illustrated by Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2), which shows the same frequency
polygon as in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1), now supplemented by a smooth curve.
This curve (“a probability density function”) describes a particular
probability distribution. It can be thought of as a smoothed version of
the shape of the frequency polygon. What we will do in the future is to
use some such probability distribution to represent the population
distribution. This means effectively arguing that we believe that the
shape of the true population distribution is sufficiently regular to be
well described by a smooth curve such as the one in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2).

In Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2) the curve and the frequency polygon have
reasonably similar shapes, so the assumption that the former is a good
representation of the latter does not seem far-fetched. However, the two
are clearly not exactly the same,  nor do we expect that
even the blood pressures of all English adults exactly match this curve
or any other simple probability distribution. All we require is that a
population distribution is close enough to a specified probability
distribution for the results from analyses based on this assumption to
be meaningful and not misleading.

![(\#fig:f-bp2)The frequency polygon of Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1), together with a normal
curve with the same mean and variance.](bloodp2){width="11.5cm"}

\label{p-model} Such a simplifying assumption about the population
distribution is known as a **statistical model** for the population. The
reason for working with a model is that it leads to much simpler methods
of analysis than would otherwise be required. For example, the shape of
the distribution shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2) is entirely determined by
just two parameters, its mean and variance. Under this model, all
questions about the population distribution can thus be reduced to
questions about these two population parameters, and inference can focus
on tests and confidence intervals for them.

The potential cost of choosing a specific probability distribution as
the statistical model for a particular application is that the
assumption may be inappropriate for the data at hand, and if it is,
conclusions about population parameters derived from analyses based on
this assumption may be misleading. The distribution should thus be
chosen carefully, usually based on both substantive considerations and
initial descriptive examination of the observed data.

For example, the particular probability distribution shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bp2), which is known as the normal distribution, is by definition
symmetric around its mean. While it is an adequate approximation of many
approximately symmetric population distributions of continuous
variables, such as that of blood pressure, many other population
distributions are not even roughly symmetric. It would be unrealistic to
assume the population distributions of such variables to be normal.
Instead, we might consider other continuous probability distributions
which can be skewed. Examples of these are the *Exponential*, *Gamma*,
*Weibull*, and *Beta* distributions. *Discrete* distributions, of
course, will require quite different probability disributions, such as
the *Binomial* distribution discussed in Chapter \@ref(c-probs), or the
*Multinomial* and *Poisson* distributions. On this course, however, we
will not include further discussion of these various possibilities.

### The normal distribution as a population distribution {#ss-contd-probdistrs-normal}

The particular probability distribution that is included in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-bp2) is a **normal distribution**, also known as the *Gaussian*
distribution, after the great German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss
who was one of the first to derive it in 1809. Figure \@ref(fig:f-10dm) shows
a portrait of Gauss from the former German 10-DM banknote, together with
pictures of the university town of Göttingen and of the normal curve
(even the mathematical formula of the curve is engraved on the note).
The curve of the normal distribution is also known as the “bell curve”
because of its shape.

![(\#fig:f-10dm)A portrait of Gauss and the normal curve on a former German 10-DM banknote.](mark){width="14cm"}

The normal distribution is by far the most important probability
distribution in statistics. The main reason for this is its use as a
sampling distribution in a wide range of contexts, for reasons that are
explained in Section \@ref(s-contd-clt). However, the normal distribution
is also useful for describing many approximately symmetric population
distributions, and it is in this context that we introduce its
properties first.

A normal distribution is completely specified by two numbers, its mean
(or “expected value”) $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$. This is sometimes
expressed in notation as $Y\sim N(\mu, \sigma^{2})$, which is read as
“$Y$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$”.
Different values for $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$ give different
distributions. For example, the curve in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2) is that of
the $N(74.2, \, 127.87)$ distribution, where the mean $\mu=74.2$ and
variance $\sigma^{2}=127.87$ are the same as the mean and variance
calculated from formulas (\@ref(eq:mu)) and (\@ref(eq:sigma2)) for the 4489
observations of blood pressure. This ensures that this particular normal
curve best matches the frequency polygon in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2).

The mean $\mu$ describes the central tendency of the distribution, and
the variance $\sigma^{2}$ its variability. This is illustrated by Figure
\@ref(fig:f-3norms), which shows the curves for three different normal
distributions. The mean of a normal distribution is also equal to both
its median and its mode. Thus $\mu$ is the central value in the sense
that it divides the distribution into two equal halves, and it also
indicates the peak of the curve (the highest probability, as discussed
below). In Figure \@ref(fig:f-3norms), the curves for $N(0, 1)$ and $N(0, 9)$
are both centered around $\mu=0$; the mean of the $N(5, 1)$ distribution
is $\mu=5$, so the whole curve is shifted to the right and centered
around 5.

![(\#fig:f-3norms)Three normal distributions with different means and/or variances.](threenorms){width="11cm"}

The variance $\sigma^{2}$ determines how widely spread the curve is. In
Figure \@ref(fig:f-3norms), the curves for $N(0, 1)$ and $N(5, 1)$ have the
same variance $\sigma^{2}=1$, so they have the same shape in terms of
their spread. The curve for $N(0, 9)$, on the other hand, is more spread
out, because it has a higher variance of $\sigma^{2}=9$. As before, it
is often more convenient to describe variability in terms of the
standard deviation $\sigma$, which is the square root of the variance.
Thus we may also say that the $N(0, 9)$ distribution has the standard
deviation $\sigma=\sqrt{9}=3$ (for $\sigma^{2}=1$ the two numbers are
the same, since $\sqrt{1}=1$).

In the histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1), the heights of the bars
correspond to the proportions of different ranges of blood pressure
among the 4489 people in the data set. Another way of stating this is
that if we were to sample a person from this group at random, the
heights of the bars indicate the **probabilities** that the selected
person’s blood pressure would be in a particular range. Some values are
clearly more likely than others. For example, for blood pressures in the
range 50–51.5, the probability is about 0.0025, corresponding to a low
bar, while for the range 74–75.5 it is about 0.0365, corresponding to a
much higher bar.

The interpretation is the same for the curve of a continuous probability
distribution. Its height also indicates the probability of different
values in random sampling from a population with that distribution. More
precisely, the *areas* under the curve give such probabilities for
ranges of values. Probabilities of all the possible values must add up
to one, so the area under the whole curve is one — i.e. a randomly
sampled unit must have *some* value of the variable in question. More
generally, the area under the curve for a range of values gives the
probability that the value of a randomly sampled observation is in that
range. These are the same principles that we have already used to derive
$P$-values for tests in Sections \@ref(ss-tables-chi2test-Pval) and
\@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd).

![(\#fig:f-norm1)Illustration of probabilities for the normal distribution. The
probability of an observation being within one standard deviation of the
mean (the grey area) is 0.68, and the probability of it being within
1.96 standard deviations of the mean (grey and shaded areas together) is
0.95.](norm1){width="12cm"}

Figure \@ref(fig:f-norm1) illustrates this further with some results which
hold for any normal distribution, whatever its mean and variance. The
grey area in the figure corresponds to values from $\mu-\sigma$ to
$\mu+\sigma$, i.e. those values which are no further than one standard
deviation from the mean. The area of the grey region is 0.68, so the
probability that a randomly sampled value from a normal distribution is
within one standard deviation of the mean is 0.68. The two shaded
regions either side of the grey area extend the area to 1.96 standard
deviations below and above the mean. The probability of this region (the
grey and shaded areas together) is 0.95. Rounding the 1.96 to 2, we can
thus say that approximately 95% of observations drawn from a normal
distribution tend to be within two standard deviations of the mean. This
leaves the remaining 5% in the two tails of the distribution, further
than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean (the two white areas in
Figure \@ref(fig:f-norm1)). Because the normal distribution is symmetric,
these two areas are of equal size and each thus has the probability
0.025 (i.e. 0.05/2).

Such calculations can also be used to determine probabilities in
particular examples. Returning to the blood pressure data, we might for
example be interested in

-   the proportion of people in some population whose diastolic blood
    pressure is higher than 90 (one possible cut-off point for high
    blood pressure or hypertension)

-   the proportion of people with diastolic blood pressure below 60
    (possibly indicating unusually low blood pressure or hypotension)

-   the proportion of people in the normal pressure range of 60–90

![(\#fig:f-normbp)Illustration of probabilities for a normal distribution in the blood pressure example, where $\mu=74.2$ and $\sigma=11.3$. The plot shows probabilities for the ranges of values at most 60 (“Low”), between 60 and 90 ("Mid”) and over 90 (“High”).](normbp){width="12cm"}

Such figures might be of interest for example for predicting health
service needs for treating hypertension. Suppose that we were reasonably
confident (perhaps from surveys like the one described above) that the
distribution of diastolic blood pressure in the population of interest
was approximately normally distributed with mean 74.2 and variance
127.87 (and thus standard deviation 11.3). The probabilities of interest
are then the areas of the regions shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-normbp).

The remaining question is how to calculate such probabilities. The short
answer is “with a computer”. However, to explain an approach which is
required for this in some computer packages and also to provide an
alternative method which does not require a computer, we need to
introduce one more new quantity. This is the **Z score**, which is
defined as
\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{Y-\mu}{\sigma}
(\#eq:Zscore)
\end{equation}
 where $Y$ can be any value of the variable of interest.
For example, in the blood pressure example the $Z$ scores corresponding
to values 60 and 90 are $Z=(60-74.2)/11.3=-1.26$ and
$Z=(90-74.2)/11.3=1.40$ respectively. The $Z$ score can be interpreted
as the distance of the value $Y$ from the mean $\mu$, measured in
standard deviations $\sigma$. Thus the blood pressure 60, with a $Z$
score of $-1.26$, is 1.26 standard deviations *below* (hence the
negative sign) the mean, while 90 (with $Z$ score 1.40) is 1.40 standard
deviations *above* the mean.

The probability distribution of the $Z$ scores is a normal distribution
with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e. $Z\sim N(0,1)$. This is known as the
**standard normal distribution**. The usefulness of $Z$ scores lies in
the fact that by transforming the original variable $Y$ from the
$N(\mu, \sigma^{2}$) distribution into the standard normal distribution
they remove the specific values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ from the
calculation. With this trick, probabilities for any normal distribution
can be calculated using a single table for $Z$ scores. Such a table is
given in the Appendix, and an extract
from it is shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-normtab) (note that it is not always
presented exactly like this, as different books may use slightly
different format or notation). The first column lists values of the $Z$
score (a full table would typically give all values from 0.00 to about
3.50). The second column, labelled “Tail Prob.”, gives the probability
that a $Z$ score for a normal distribution is *larger than* the value
given by $z$, i.e. the area of the region to the right of $z$.


         $z$   Tail Prob. 
  ---------- -------------
         ...           ...
        1.24        0.1075
        1.25        0.1056
        1.26        0.1038
        1.27        0.1020
         ...           ...
        1.38        0.0838
        1.39        0.0823
        1.40        0.0808
        1.41        0.0793
         ...           ...

  : (\#tab:t-normtab)Extract from the table of right-hand tail probabilities for normal $Z$ scores. Here “Tail Prob.” is the probability that a value from the standard normal distribution is at least the value in the column
  labelled “$z$”. The full table is shown in the Appendix.


Consider first the probability that blood pressure is greater than 90,
i.e. the area labelled “High” in Figure \@ref(fig:f-normbp). We have seen
that 90 corresponds to a $Z$ score of 1.40, so the probability of high
blood pressure is the same as the probability that the normal $Z$ score
is greater than 1.40. The row for $z=1.40$ in the table tells us that
this probability is 0.0808, or 0.08 when rounded to two decimal places
as in Figure \@ref(fig:f-normbp).

The second quantity of interest was the probability of a blood pressure
at most 60, i.e. the area of the “Low” region in Figure \@ref(fig:f-normbp).
The corresponding $Z$ score is $-1.26$. The table, however, shows only
positive values of $z$. This is because we can use the symmetry of the
normal distribution to reduce all such questions to ones about positive
values of $z$. Because the distribution is symmetric, the probability
that a $Z$ score is *at most* $-1.26$ (the area of the left-hand tail to
the left of $-1.26$) is the same as the probability that it is *at
least* 1.26 (the area of the right-hand tail to the right of 1.26). This
is the kind of quantity we calculated above.^[Note that there we were looking for the probability of a Z score
being “bigger than” rather than “at least” a certain value; for a
continuous probability distribution this makes no difference, and
both probabilities are the same.] The required
probability is thus equal to the right-hand tail probability for 1.26,
which the table shows to be 0.1038 (rounded to 0.10 in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-normbp)).

Finally, the probability of the “Mid” range of blood pressure is the
remaining probability not in the two other regions. Because the whole
area under the curve (the total probability) is 1, the required
probability is obtained by subtraction as $1-(0.0808+0.1038)=0.8154$. In
this example these values obtained from the normal approximation of the
population distribution are very accurate. The exact proportions of the
4489 respondents who had diastolic blood pressure at most 60 or greater
than 90 were 0.0996 and 0.0793 respectively, so rounded to two decimal
places they were the same as the 0.10 and 0.08 obtained from the normal
approximation.

 These days we can use statistical computer programs to
calculate such probabilities directly for a normal distribution with any
mean and standard deviation. For example, SPSS has a function called
`CDF.NORMAL(`*quant,mean,stddev*`)` for this purpose. It calculates the
probability that the value from a normal distribution with mean *mean*
and standard deviation *stddev* is **at most** *quant*.

In practice we do not usually know the population mean and variance, so
their sample estimates will be used in such calculations. For example,
for the sample in Table \@ref(tab:t-bp-example) we had $\bar{Y}=72.6$ and
$s=12.7$. Using these values in a similar calculation as above gives the
estimated proportion of people in the population with diastolic blood
pressures over 90 as 8.5%. Even with a sample of only 50 observations,
the estimate is reasonably close to the true population proportion of
about 8.1%.

## The normal distribution as a sampling distribution {#s-contd-clt}

We have already encountered the normal distribution in Section
\@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd), in the role of the *sampling
distribution* of a test statistic rather than as a model for the
population distribution of a variable. In fact, the most important use
of the normal distribution is as a sampling distribution, because in
this role it often cannot be replaced by any other simple distributions.
The reasons for this claim are explained in this section. We begin with
the case of the distribution of the sample mean in samples from a normal
population, before extending it with a result which provides the
justification for the standard normal sampling distributions used for
inference on proportions in Chapter \@ref(c-probs), and even for the
$\chi^{2}$ sampling distribution of the $\chi^{2}$ test in Chapter
\@ref(c-tables).

Recall from Section \@ref(ss-tables-chi2test-sdist) that the sampling
distribution of a statistic is its distribution across all possible
random samples of a given size from a population. The statistic we focus
on here is the sample mean $\bar{Y}$. If we assume that the population
distribution is exactly normal, we have the following result:

-   If the population distribution of a variable $Y$ is normal with mean
    $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$, the sampling distribution of the
    sample mean $\bar{Y}$ for a random sample of size $n$ is also a
    normal distribution, with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}/n$.

The mean and variance of this sampling distribution are worth discussing
separately:

-   The mean of the sampling distribution of $\bar{Y}$ is equal to the
    population mean $\mu$ of $Y$. This means that while $\bar{Y}$ from a
    single sample may be below or above the true $\mu$, in repeated
    samples it would on average estimate the correct parameter. In
    statistical language, $\bar{Y}$ is then an *unbiased estimate* of
    $\mu$. More generally, most possible samples would give values of
    $\bar{Y}$ not very far from $\mu$, where the scale for “far” is
    provided by the standard deviation discussed below.

-   The variance of the sampling distribution of $\bar{Y}$ is
    $\sigma^{2}/n$ or, equivalently, its standard deviation is
    $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$. This standard deviation is also known as the
    **standard error of the mean**, and is often denoted by something
    like $\sigma_{\bar{Y}}$. It describes the variability of the
    sampling distribution. Its magnitude depends on $\sigma$, i.e. on
    the variability of $Y$ in the population. More interestingly, it
    also depends on the sample size $n$, which appears in the
    denominator in $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$. This means that the standard error
    of the mean is smaller for large samples than for small ones. This
    is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld2). It shows the sampling
    distribution of $\bar{Y}$ for samples of sizes $n=50$ and $n=1000$
    from a normal population with $\mu=74.2$ and $\sigma=11.3$, i.e. the
    population mean and standard deviation in the blood pressure
    example. It can be seen that while both sampling distributions are
    centered around the true mean $\mu=74.2$, the distribution for the
    smaller sample is more spread out than that for the larger sample:
    more precisely, the standard error of the mean is
    $\sigma/\sqrt{n}=11.3/\sqrt{50}=1.60$ when $n=50$ and
    $11.3/\sqrt{1000}=0.36$ when $n=1000$. Recalling from Section
    \@ref(ss-contd-probdistrs-normal) that approximately 95% of the
    probability in a normal distribution is within two standard
    deviations of the mean, this means that about 95% of samples of size
    50 in this case would give a value of $\bar{Y}$ between
    $\mu-2*1.60=74.2-3.2=71.0$ and $74.2+3.2=77.4$. For samples of size
    $n=1000$, on the other hand, 95% of samples would yield $\bar{Y}$ in
    the much narrower range of $74.2-2*0.36=73.5$ to $74.2+2*0.36=74.9$.

sample sizes. In both cases the population distribution is normal with

The connection between sample size and the variability of a sampling
distribution applies not only to the sample mean but to (almost) all
estimates of population parameters. In general, (i) the task of
statistical inference is to use information in a sample to draw
conclusions about population parameters; (ii) the expected magnitude of
the sampling error, i.e. the remaining uncertainty about population
parameters resulting from having information only on a sample, is
characterised by the variability of the sampling distributions of
estimates of the parameters; and (iii) other things being equal, the
variability of a sampling distribution decreases when the sample size
increases. Thus data really are the currency of statistics and more data
are better than less data. In practice data collection of course costs
time and money, so we cannot always obtain samples which are as large as
we might otherwise want. Apart from resource constraints, the choice of
sample size depends also on such things as the aims of the analysis, the
level of precision required, and guesses about the variability of
variables in the population. Statistical considerations of the
trade-offs between them in order to make decisions about sample sizes
are known as *power* calculations. They will be discussed very briefly
later, in Section \@ref(ss-means-tests3-power).

In Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld) we use a computer simulation rather than a
mathematical theorem to examine the sampling distribution of a sample
mean. Here 100,000 simple random samples of size $n=50$ were drawn from
the $N=4489$ values of blood pressure that we are treating as the finite
population in this illustration. The sample mean $\bar{Y}$ of blood
pressure was calculated for each of these samples, and the histogram of
these 100,000 values of $\bar{Y}$ is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld).
Also shown is the curve of the normal distribution with the mean $\mu$
and standard deviation $\sigma/\sqrt{50}$ determined by the theoretical
result given above.

![(\#fig:f-sampld)Example of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The plot
shows a histogram of the values of the sample mean in 100,000 samples of
size $n=50$ drawn from the 4489 values of diastolic blood pressure shown
in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp1), for which the mean is $\mu=74.2$ and standard
deviation is $\sigma=11.3$. Superimposed on the histogram is the curve
of the approximate sampling distribution, which is normal with mean
$\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.](sampld1_bp){width="12cm"}

The match between the curve and the histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld)
is clearly very close. This is actually a nontrivial finding which
illustrates a result which is of crucial importance for statistical
inference. Recall that the normal curve shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld)
is derived from the mathematical result stated above, which assumed that
the population distribution of $Y$ is *exactly* normal. The histogram in
Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld), on the other hand, is based on repeated samples
from the actual population distribution of blood pressure, which, while
quite close to a normal distribution as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-bp2), is
certainly not exactly normal. Despite this, it is clear that the normal
curve describes the histogram essentially exactly.

If this was not true, that is if the sampling distribution that applies
for the normal distribution was inadequate when the the true population
distribution was even slightly different from normal, the result would
be of little practical use. No population distribution is ever exactly
normal, and many are very far from normality. Fortunately, however, it
turns out that quite the opposite is true, and that the sampling
distribution of the mean is approximately the same for nearly *all*
population distributions. This is the conclusion from the **Central
Limit Theorem** (CLT), one of the most remarkable results in all of
mathematics. Establishing the CLT with increasing levels of generality
has been the work of many mathematicians over several centuries, as
different versions of it have been proved by, among others, de Moivre,
Laplace, Cauchy, Chebyshev, Markov, Liapounov, Lindeberg, Feller, Lévy,
Hoeffding, Robbins, and Rebolledo between about 1730 and 1980. One
version of the CLT can be stated as

**The (Lindeberg-Feller) Central Limit Theorem**: For each
$n=1,2,\dots$, let $Y_{nj}$, for $j=1,2,\dots,n$, be independent random
variables with $\text{E}(Y_{nj})=0$ and
$\text{var}(Y_{nj})=\sigma^{2}_{nj}$. Let $Z_{n}=\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{nj}$,
and let $B^{2}_{n}=\text{var}(Z_{n})=\sum_{j=1}^{n} \sigma^{2}_{nj}$.
Suppose also that the following condition holds: for every $\epsilon>0$,
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{B_{n}^{2}}\,\sum_{j=1}^{n} \, \text{E}\{ Y_{nj}^{2} I(|Y_{nj}|\ge \epsilon B_{n})\}\rightarrow 0 \; \text{  as  } \; n\rightarrow \infty.
(\#eq:lindeberg)
\end{equation}
 Then
$Z_{n}/B_{n} \stackrel{\mathcal{L}}{\longrightarrow} N(0,1)$.

No, that will not come up in the examination. The theorem is given here
just as a glimpse of how this topic would be introduced in a very
different kind of text book,^[Ferguson, T. S. (1996). *A Course in Large Sample Theory*, Chapman
& Hall, London.] and because it pleases the author of
this coursepack to note that Jarl Lindeberg was Finnish. For our
purposes, it is better to state the same result in English:

-   If $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \dots, Y_{n}$ are a random sample of observations
    from (almost)^[The CLT does not hold in some rather weird cases which need not
    concern us here. Condition (\@ref(eq:lindeberg)) is a mathematical
    expression for “not weird”.] any distribution with a population mean $\mu$ and
    variance $\sigma^{2}$, and if $n$ is reasonably large, the sampling
    distribution of their sample mean $\bar{Y}$ is approximately a
    normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}/n$.

Thus the sampling distribution of the mean from practically any
population distribution is approximately the same as when the population
distribution is normal, as long as the sample size is “reasonably
large”. The larger the sample size is, the closer the sampling
distribution is to the normal distribution, and it becomes exactly
normal when the sample size is infinitely large (i.e. “asymptotically”).
What is large enough depends particularly on the nature of the
population distribution. For continuous variables, the CLT approximation
is typically adequate even for sample sizes as small as $n=30$, so we
can make use of the approximate normal sampling distribution when $n$ is
30 or larger. This is, of course, simply a pragmatic rule of thumb which
does not mean that the normal approximation is completely appropriate
for $n=30$ but entirely inappropriate for $n=29$; rather, the
approximation becomes better and better as the sample size increases,
while below about 30 the chance of incorrect conclusions from using it
becomes large enough for us not to usually want to take that risk.

We have seen in Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld2) that in the blood pressure
example the sampling distribution given by the Central Limit Theorem is
essentially exact for samples of size $n=50$. In this case this is
hardly surprising, as the population distribution itself is already
quite close to a normal distribution. The theorem is not, however,
limited to such easy cases but works quite generally. To demonstrate
this with a more severe test, let us consider a population distribution
that is as far as possible from normal. This is the binomial
distribution of a binary variable that was introduced in Section
\@ref(s-probs-distribution). If the probability parameter of this
distribution is $\pi$, its mean and variance are $\mu=\pi$ and
$\sigma^{2}=\pi(1-\pi)$, and the sample mean $\bar{Y}$ of observations
from the distribution is the sample proportion $\hat{\pi}$ (see the equation at the end of Section \@ref(s-probs-pointest)). The CLT then tells
us that

-   When $n$ is large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample
    proportion $\hat{\pi}$ of a dichotomous variable $Y$ with population
    proportion $\pi$ is approximately a normal distribution with mean
    $\pi$ and variance $\pi(1-\pi)/n$.

This powerful result is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:f-cltbin). It is
similar to Figure \@ref(fig:f-sampld) in that it shows sampling distributions
obtained from a computer simulation, together with the normal curve
suggested by the CLT. For each plot, 5000 samples of size $n$ were
simulated from a population where $\pi$ was 0.2. The sample proportion
$\hat{\pi}$ was then calculated for each simulated sample, and the
histogram of these 5000 values drawn. Four different sample sizes were
used: $n=10$, 30, 100, and 1000. It can be seen that the normal
distribution is not a very good approximation of the sampling
distribution of $\hat{\pi}$ when $n$ is as small as 10 or even 30. For
the larger values of 100 and 1000, however, the normal approximation is
already quite good, as expected from the CLT.

![(\#fig:f-cltbin)Illustration of the Central Limit Theorem for the sample proportion of
a dichotomous variable. Each plot shows the histogram of the sample
proportions $\hat{\pi}$ calculated for 5000 samples simulated from a
population distribution with proportion $\pi=0.2$, together with the
normal curve with mean $\pi$ and variance $\pi(1-\pi)/n$. The samples
sizes $n$ are 10, 30, 100 and 1000.](sampld_p){width="13.5cm"}

The variability of the sampling distribution will again depend on $n$.
In Figure \@ref(fig:f-cltbin), the observed range of values of $\hat{\pi}$
decreases substantially as $n$ increases. When $n=10$, values of between
about 0 and 0.4 are quite common, whereas with $n=1000$, essentially all
of the samples give $\hat{\pi}$ between about 0.16 and 0.24, and a large
majority are between 0.18 and 0.22. Thus increasing the sample size will
again increase the precision with which we can estimate $\pi$, and
decrease the uncertainty in inference about its true value.

The Central Limit Theorem is, with some additional results, the
justification for the standard normal sampling distribution used for
tests and confidence intervals for proportions in Chapter \@ref(c-probs).
The conditions for sample sizes mentioned there (at the beginning of Section \@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd) and \@ref(s-probs-2samples)) again derive from conditions
for the CLT to be adequate. The same is also ultimately true for the
$\chi^{2}$ distribution and conditions for the $\chi^{2}$ test in
Chapter \@ref(c-tables). Results like these, and many others, explain the
central importance of the CLT in statistical methodology.
