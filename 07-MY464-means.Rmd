# Analysis of population means {#c-means}

## Introduction and examples {#s-means-intro}

This chapter introduces some basic methods of analysis for continuous,
interval-level variables. The main focus is on statistical inference on
population *means* of such variables, but some new methods of
descriptive statistics are also described. The discussion draws on the
general ideas that have already been explaned for inference in Chapters
\@ref(c-tables) and \@ref(c-probs), and for continuous distributions in
Chapter \@ref(c-contd). Few if any new concepts thus need to be
introduced here. Instead, this chapter can focus on describing the
specifics of these very commonly used methods for continuous variables.

As in Chapter \@ref(c-probs), questions on both a single group and on
comparisons between two groups are discussed here. Now, however, the
main focus is on the two-group case. There we treat the group as the
explanatory variable $X$ and the continuous variable of interest as the
response variable $Y$, and assess the possible associations between $X$
and $Y$ by comparing the distributions (and especially the means) of $Y$
in the two groups.

The following five examples will be used for illustration throughout
this chapter. Summary statistics for them are shown in Table
\@ref(tab:t-groupex).

**Example 7.1: Survey data on diet**

The National Diet and Nutrition Survey of adults aged 19–64 living in
private households in Great Britain was carried out in 2000–01.^[Conducted for the Food Standards Agency and the Department of
Health by ONS and MRC Human Nutrition Research. The sample
statistics used here are from the survey reports published by HMSO
in 2002-04, aggregating results published separately for men and
women. The standard errors have been adjusted for non-constant
sampling probabilities using design factors published in the survey
reports. We will treat these numbers as if they were from a simple
random sample.] One
part of the survey was a food diary where the respondents recorded all
food and drink they consumed in a seven-day period. We consider two
variables derived from the diary: the consumption of fruit and
vegetables in portions (of 400g) per day (with mean in the sample of
size $n=1724$ of $\bar{Y}=2.8$, and standard deviation $s=2.15$), and
the percentage of daily food energy intake obtained from fat and fatty
acids ($n=1724$, $\bar{Y}=35.3$, and $s=6.11$).

**Two independent samples**

*Example 7.2: Average weekly hours spent on housework*

&nbsp;&nbsp;Men                                                                      635           7.33      5.53

&nbsp;&nbsp;Women                                                                    469           8.49      6.14        1.16

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunglasses                                                                66           6.49      2.01       -1.74

&nbsp;&nbsp;One month after the birth                                                109          30.77      2.58        0.08

&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday the 13th                                                           10        126,550      1176       -1835

:(\#tab:t-groupex)Examples of analyses of population means used in Chapter \@ref(c-means). Here $n$ and $\bar{Y}$ denote the sample size and sample mean respectively, in the two-group examples 7.2–7.5 separately for the two groups. “Diff.” denotes the between-group difference of means, and $s$ is the sample standard deviation of the response variable $Y$ for the whole sample (Example 7.1), of the response variable within each group (Examples 7.2 and 7.3), or of the within-pair differences (Examples 7.4 and 7.5).

**Example 7.2: Housework by men and women**

This example uses data from the 12th wave of the British Household Panel
Survey (BHPS), collected in 2002. BHPS is an ongoing survey of UK
households, measuring a range of socioeconomic variables. One of the
questions in 2002 was

*“About how many hours do you spend on housework in an average week,
such as time spent cooking, cleaning and doing the laundry?”*

The response to this question (recorded in whole hours) will be the
response variable $Y$, and the respondent’s sex will be the explanatory
variable $X$. We consider only those respondents who were less than 65
years old at the time of the interview and who lived in single-person
households (thus the comparisons considered here will not involve
questions of the division of domestic work within families).^[The data were obtained from the UK Data Archive. Three respondents
with outlying values of the housework variable (two women and one
man, with 50, 50 and 70 reported weekly hours) have been omitted
from the analysis considered here.]

We can indicate summary statistics separately for the two groups by
using subscripts 1 for men and 2 for women (for example). The sample
sizes are $n_{1}=635$ for men and $n_{2}=469$ for women, and the sample
means of $Y$ are $\bar{Y}_{1}=7.33$ and $\bar{Y}_{2}=8.49$. These and
the sample standard deviations $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are also shown in
Table \@ref(tab:t-groupex).

**Example 7.3: Eye contact and perceived friendliness of police officers**

This example is based on an experiment conducted to examine the effects
of some aspects of the appearance and behaviour of police officers on
how members of the public perceive their encounters with the police.^[Boyanowsky, E. O. and Griffiths, C. T. (1982). “Weapons and eye
contact as instigators or inhibitors of aggressive arousal in
police-citizen interaction”. *Journal of Applied Social Psychology*,
**12**, 398–407.]
The subjects of the study were 133 people stopped by the Traffic Patrol
Division of a detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When
talking to the driver who had been stopped, the police officer either
wore reflective sunglasses which hid his eyes, or wore no glasses at
all, thus permitting eye contact with the respondent. These two
conditions define the explanatory variable $X$, coded 1 if the officer
wore no glasses and 2 if he wore sunglasses. The choice of whether
sunglasses were worn was made at random before a driver was stopped.

While the police officer went back to his car to write out a report, a
researcher asked the respondent some further questions, one of which is
used here as the response variable $Y$. It is a measure of the
respondent’s perception of the friendliness of the police officer,
measured on a 10-point scale where large values indicate high levels of
friendliness.

The article describing the experiment does not report all the summary
statistics needed for our purposes. The statistics shown in Table
\@ref(tab:t-groupex) have thus been partially made up for use here. They are,
however, consistent with the real results from the study. In particular,
the direction and statistical significance of the difference between
$\bar{Y}_{2}$ and $\bar{Y}_{1}$ are the same as those in the published
report.

**Example 7.4: Transition to parenthood**

In a study of the stresses and feelings associated with parenthood, 109
couples expecting their first child were interviewed before and after
the birth of the baby.^[Miller, B. C. and Sollie, D. L. (1980). “Normal stresses during
the transition to parenthood”. *Family Relations*, **29**, 459–465.
See the article for further information, including results for the
mothers.] Here we consider only data for the fathers,
and only one of the variables measured in the study. This variable is a
measure of personal well-being, obtained from a seven-item attitude
scale, where larger values indicate higher levels of well-being.
Measurements of it were obtained for each father at three time points:
when the mother was six months pregnant, one month after the birth of
the baby, and six months after the birth. Here we will use only the
first two of the measurements. The response variable $Y$ will thus be
the measure of personal well-being, and the explanatory variable $X$
will be the time of measurement (sixth month of the pregnancy or one
month after the birth). The means of $Y$ at the two times are shown in
Table \@ref(tab:t-groupex). As in Example 7.3, not all of the numbers needed
here were given in the original article. Specifically, the standard
error of the difference in Table \@ref(tab:t-groupex) has been made up in
such a way that the results of a significance test for the mean
difference agree with those in the article.

**Example 7.5: Traffic patterns on Friday the 13th**

A common superstition regards the 13th day of any month falling on a
Friday as a particularly unlucky day. In a study examining the possible
effects of this belief on people’s behaviour,^[Scanlon, T. J. et al. (1993). “Is Friday the 13th bad for your
health?”. *British Medical Journal*, **307**, 1584–1586. The data
were obtained from The Data and Story Library at Carnegie Mellon
University (`lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL`).] data were obtained on
the numbers of vehicles travelling between junctions 7 and 8 and
junctions 9 and 10 on the M25 motorway around London during every Friday
the 13th in 1990–92. For comparison, the same numbers were also recorded
during the previous Friday (i.e. the 6th) in each case. There are only
ten such pairs here, and the full data set is shown in Table
\@ref(tab:t-F13). Here the explanatory variable $X$ indicates whether a day
is Friday the 6th (coded as 1) or Friday the 13th (coded as 2), and the
response variable is the number of vehicles travelling between two
junctions.

In each of these cases, we will regard the variable of interest $Y$ as a
continuous, interval-level variable. The five examples illustrate three
different situations considered in this chapter. Example 7.1 includes
two separate $Y$-variables (consumption of fruit and vegetables, and fat
intake), each of which is considered for a single population. Questions
of interest are about the mean of the variable in the population. This
is analogous to the one-group questions on proportions in Sections
\@ref(s-probs-test1sample) and \@ref(s-probs-1sampleci). In this chapter
the one-group case is discussed only relatively briefly, in Section
\@ref(s-means-1sample).

The main focus here is on the case illustrated by Examples 7.2 and 7.3.
These involve samples of a response variable (hours of housework, or
preceived friendliness) from two groups (men and women, or police with
or without sunglasses). We are then interested in comparing the
distributions, and especially the means, of the response variable
between the groups. This case will be discussed first. Descriptive
statistics for it are described in Section \@ref(s-means-descr), and
statistical inference in Section \@ref(s-means-inference).

Finally, examples 7.4 and 7.5 also involve comparisons between two
groups, but of a slightly different kind than examples 7.2 and 7.3. The
two types of cases differ in the nature of the two samples (groups)
being compared. \label{p-depsamples} In Examples 7.2 and 7.3, the
samples can be considered to be **independent**. What this claim means
will be discussed briefly later; informally, it is justified in these
examples because the subjects in the two groups are separate and
unrelated individuals. In Examples 7.4 and 7.5, in contrast, the samples
(before and after the birth of a child, or two successive Fridays) must
be considered **dependent**, essentially because they concern
measurements on the same units at two distinct times. This case is
discussed in Section \@ref(s-means-dependent).

In each of the four two-group examples we are primarily interested in
questions about possible association between the group variable $X$ and
the response variable $Y$. As before, this is the question of whether
the conditional distributions of $Y$ are different at the two levels of
$X$. There is thus an association between $X$ and $Y$ if

-   Example 7.2: The distribution of hours of housework is different for
    men than for women.

-   Example 7.3: The distribution of perceptions of a police officer’s
    friendliness is different when he is wearing mirrored sunglasses
    than when he is not.

-   Example 7.4: The distribution of measurements of personal well-being
    is different at the sixth month of the pregnancy than one month
    after the birth.

-   Example 7.5: The distributions of the numbers of cars on the
    motorway differ between Friday the 6th and the following Friday
    the 13th.

We denote the two values of $X$, i.e. the two groups, by 1 and 2. The
mean of the population distribution of $Y$ given $X=1$ will be denoted
$\mu_{1}$ and the standard deviation $\sigma_{1}$, and the mean and
standard deviation of the population distribution given $X=2$ are
denoted $\mu_{2}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ similarly. The corresponding sample
quantities are the conditional sample means $\bar{Y}_{1}$ and
$\bar{Y}_{2}$ and sample standard deviations $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. For
inference, we will focus on the population difference
$\Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}$ which is estimated by the sample difference
$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}$. Some of the descriptive methods
described in Section \@ref(s-means-descr), on the other hand, also aim to
summarise and compare other aspects of the two conditional sample
distributions.

## Descriptive statistics for comparisons of groups {#s-means-descr}

### Graphical methods of comparing sample distributions {#ss-means-descr-graphs}

There is an association between the group variable $X$ and the response
variable $Y$ if the distributions of $Y$ in the two groups are not the
same. To determine the extent and nature of any such association, we
need to compare the two distributions. This section describes methods of
doing so for observed data, i.e. for examining associations in a sample.
We begin with graphical methods which can be used to detect differences
in any aspects of the two distributions. We then discuss some
non-graphical summaries which compare specific aspects of the sample
distributions, especially their means.

Although the methods of *inference* described later in this chapter will
be limited to the case where the group variable $X$ is dichotomous, many
of the descriptive methods discussed below can just as easily be applied
when more than two groups are being compared. This will be mentioned
wherever appropriate. For inference in the multiple-group case some of
the methods discussed in Chapter \@ref(c-regression) are applicable.

In Section \@ref(ss-descr1-1cont-graphs) we described four graphical
methods of summarizing the sample distribution of one continuous
variable $Y$: the histogram, the stem and leaf plot, the frequency
polygon and the box plot. Each of these can be adapted for comparisons
of two or more distributions, although some more conveniently than
others. We illustrate the use three of the plots for this purpose, using
the comparison of housework hours in Example 7.2 for illustration. Stem
and leaf plots will not be shown, because they are less appropriate when
the sample sizes are as large as they are in this example.

Two sample distributions can be compared by displaying histograms of
them side by side, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-hworkpyramid). This is not
a very common type of graph, and not ideal for visually comparing the
two distributions, because the bars to be compared (here for men
vs. women) end at opposite ends of the plot. A better alternative is to
use frequency polygons. Since these represent a sample distribution by a
single line, it is easy to include two of them in the same plot, as
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:f-hworkpolygons). Finally, Figure
\@ref(fig:f-twoboxplots) shows two boxplots of reported housework hours, one
for men and one for women.

The plots suggest that the distributions are quite similar for men and
women. In both groups, the largest proportion of respondents stated that
they do between 4 and 7 hours of housework a week. The distributions are
clearly positively skewed, since the reported number of hours was much
higher than average for a number of people (whereas less than zero hours
were of course not recorded for anyone). The proportions of observations
in categories including values 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 tend to be
relatively high, suggesting that many respondents chose to report their
answers in such round numbers. The box plots show that the median number
of hours is higher for women than for men (7 vs. 6 hours), and women’s
responses have slightly less variation, as measured by both the IQR and
the range of the whiskers. Both distributions have several larger,
outlying observations (note that SPSS, which was used to produce Figure
\@ref(fig:f-twoboxplots), divides outliers into moderate and “extreme” ones;
the latter are observations more than 3 IQR from the end of the box, and
are plotted with asterisks).

![(\#fig:f-twoboxplots)Box plots of the sample distributions of reported weekly hours of housework in Example 7.2, separately for men and women.](twoboxplots){width="11cm"}

Figures \@ref(fig:f-hworkpyramid)–\@ref(fig:f-twoboxplots) also illustrate an
important general point about such comparisons. Typically we focus on
comparing *means* of the conditional distributions. Here the difference
between the sample means is 1.16, i.e. women in the sample spend, on
average, over an hour longer on housework per week than men. The
direction of the difference could also be guessed from Figure
\@ref(fig:f-hworkpolygons), which shows that somewhat smaller proportions of
women than of men report small numbers of hours, and larger proportions
of women report large numbers. This difference will later be shown to be
statistically significant, and it is also arguably relatively large in a
substantive sense.

However, it is equally important to note that the two distributions
summarized by the graphs are nevertheless largely similar. For example,
even though the mean is higher for women, there are clearly many women
who report spending hardly any time on housework, and many men who spend
a lot of time on it. In other words, the two distributions overlap to a
large extent. This obvious point is often somewhat neglected in public
discussions of differences between groups such as men and women or
different ethnic groups. It is not uncommon to see reports of research
indicating that (say) men have higher or lower values of something or
other then women. Such statements usually refer to differences of
averages, and are often clearly important and interesting. Less helpful,
however, is the tendency to discuss the differences almost as if the
corresponding distributions had no overlap at all, i.e. as if *all* men
were higher or lower in some characteristic than all women. This is
obviously hardly ever the case.

Box plots and frequency polygons can also be used to compare more than
two sample distributions. For example, the experimental conditions in
the study behind Example 7.3 actually involved not only whether or not a
police officer wore sunglasses, but also whether or not he wore a gun.
Distributions of perceived friendliness given all four combinations of
these two conditions could easily be summarized by drawing four box
plots or frequency polygons in the same plot, one for each experimental
condition.

### Comparing summary statistics {#ss-means-descr-tables}

Main features of sample distributions, such as their central tendencies
and variations, are described using the summary statistics introduced in
Section \@ref(s-descr1-nums). These too can be compared between groups.
Table \@ref(tab:t-groupex) shows such statistics for the examples of this
chapter. Tables like these are routinely reported for initial
description of data, even if more elaborate statistical methods are
later used.

Sometimes the association between two variables in a sample is
summarized in a single *measure of association* calculated from the
data. This is especially convenient when both of the variables are
continuous (in which case the most common measure of association is
known as the *correlation* coefficient). In this section we consider as
such a summary the difference $\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}$ of
the sample means of $Y$ in the two groups. These differences are also
shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-groupex).

The difference of means is important because it is also the focus of the
most common methods of inference for two-group comparisons. For purely
descriptive purposes it may be as or more convenient to report some
other statistic. For example, the difference of means of 1.16 hours in
Example 7.2 could also be described in *relative* terms by saying that
the women’s average is about 16 per cent higher than the men’s average
(because $1.16/7.33=0.158$, i.e. the difference represents 15.8 % of the
men’s average).

## Inference for two means from independent samples {#s-means-inference}

### Aims of the analysis {#ss-means-inference-intro}

Formulated as a statistical model in the sense discussed on page in Section \@ref(ss-contd-probdistrs-general), the
assumptions of the analyses considered in this section are as follows:

1.  \label{p-2sample} We have a sample of $n_{1}$ independent
    observations of a variable $Y$ in group 1, which have a population
    distribution with mean $\mu_{1}$ and standard deviation
    $\sigma_{1}$.

2.  We have a sample of $n_{2}$ independent observations of $Y$ in group
    2, which have a population distribution with mean $\mu_{2}$ and
    standard deviation $\sigma_{2}$.

3.  The two samples are independent, in the sense discussed following Example 7.5.

4.  For now, we further assume that the population standard deviations
    $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ are equal, with a common value denoted
    by $\sigma$. This relatively minor assumption will be discussed
    further in Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-variants).

We could have stated the starting points of the analyses in Chapters
\@ref(c-tables) and \@ref(c-probs) also in such formal terms. It is not
absolutely necessary to always do so, but we should at least remember
that any statistical analysis is based on some such model. In
particular, this helps to make it clear what our methods of analysis do
and do not assume, so that we may critically examine whether these
assumptions appear to be justified for the data at hand.

The model stated above does not require that the population
distributions of $Y$ should have the form of any particular probability
distribution. It is often further assumed that these distributions are
normal distributions, but this is not essential. Discussion of this
question is postponed until Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-variants).

The only new term in this model statement was the “independent” under
assumptions 1 and 2. This statistical term can be roughly translated as
“unrelated”. The condition can usually be regarded as satisfied when the
units of analysis are different entities, as in Examples 7.2 and 7.3
where the units within each group are distinct individual people. In
these examples the individuals in the two groups are also distinct, from
which it follows that the two *samples* are independent as required by
assumption 3. The same assumption of independent observations is also
required by all of the methods described in Chapters \@ref(c-tables) and
\@ref(c-probs), although we did not state this explicitly there.

This situation is illustrated by Example 7.2, where $Y$ is the number of
hours a person spends doing housework in a week, and the two groups are
men (group 1) and women (group 2).

The quantity of main interest is here the difference of population means \begin{equation} \Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}.
\label{eq:DeltaB} \end{equation} In particular, if $\Delta=0$, the population means in
the two groups are the same. If $\Delta\ne 0$, they are not the same,
which implies that there is an association between $Y$ and the group in
the population.

Inference on $\Delta$ can be carried out using methods which are
straightforward modifications of the ones introduced first in Chapter
\@ref(c-probs). For significance testing, the null hypothesis of interest
is \begin{equation}H_{0}: \; \Delta=0,
\label{eq:mH0a}\end{equation} to be tested against a two-sided ($H_{a}:\; \Delta\ne 0$)
or one-sided ($H_{a}:\; \Delta> 0$ or $H_{a}:\; \Delta< 0$) alternative
hypothesis. The test statistic used to test (\@ref(eq:mH0a)) is again of the
form \begin{equation}t=\frac{\hat{\Delta}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}}
\label{eq:tma}\end{equation} where $\hat{\Delta}$ is a sample estimate of $\Delta$, and
$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}$ its estimated standard error. Here the
statistic is conventionally labelled $t$ rather than $z$ and called the
*t-test statistic* because sometimes the $t$-distribution rather than
the normal is used as its sampling distribution. This possibility is
discussed in Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-variants), and we can
ignore it until then.

Confidence intervals for the differences $\Delta$ are also of the
familiar form
\begin{equation}\hat{\Delta} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\, \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}
\label{eq:ciDpa}\end{equation} where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the appropriate multiplier from
the standard normal distribution to obtain the required confidence
level, e.g. $z_{0.025}=1.96$ for 95% confidence intervals. The
multiplier is replaced with a slightly different one if the
$t$-distribution is used as the sampling distribution, as discussed in
Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-variants).

The details of these formulas in the case of two-sample inference on
means are described next, in Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-test) for
the significance test and in Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-ci) for the
confidence interval.

### Significance testing: The two-sample t-test {#ss-means-inference-test}

For tests of the difference of means $\Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}$ between
two population distributions, we consider the null hypothesis of no
difference \begin{equation}H_{0}: \; \Delta=0.
\label{eq:H0m}\end{equation} In the housework example, this is the hypothesis that
average weekly hours of housework in the population are the same for men
and women. It is tested against an alternative hypothesis, either the
two-sided alternative hypotheses \begin{equation}H_{a}: \; \Delta\ne 0\label{eq:Hatwom}\end{equation} or one of the one-sided alternative hypotheses
$$H_{a}:  \Delta> 0 \text{ or } H_{a}:  \Delta< 0$$ In the discussion below, we concentrate on the more
common two-sided alternative.

The test statistic for testing (\@ref(eq:H0m)) is of the general form
(\@ref(eq:tma)). Here it depends on the data only through the sample means
$\bar{Y}_{1}$ and $\bar{Y}_{2}$ and sample variances $s_{1}^{2}$ and
$s_{2}^{2}$ of $Y$ in the two groups. A point estimate of $\Delta$ is
\begin{equation}\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}.
\label{eq:Dhatmu}\end{equation} In terms of the population parameters, the standard
error of $\hat{\Delta}$ is \begin{equation}\sigma_{\hat{\Delta}}=
\sqrt{\sigma^{2}_{\bar{Y}_{2}}+
\sigma^{2}_{\bar{Y}_{1}}}=
\sqrt{
\frac{\sigma^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}+
\frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}}
}.
\label{eq:sigmaDmu}\end{equation} When we assume that the population standard
deviations $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ are equal, with a common value
$\sigma$, (\@ref(eq:sigmaDmu)) simplifies to \begin{equation}\sigma_{\hat{\Delta}} =
\sigma\; \sqrt{
\frac{1}{n_{2}}+
\frac{1}{n_{1}}
}.
\label{eq:seDpop}\end{equation} The formula of the test statistic uses an estimate of
this standard error, given by \begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}} =
\hat{\sigma} \; \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{2}}+\frac{1}{n_{1}}}
\label{eq:seD2}\end{equation} where $\hat{\sigma}$ is an estimate of $\sigma$,
calculated from \begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}=
\sqrt{\frac{(n_{2}-1)s^{2}_{2}+(n_{1}-1)s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}}.
\label{eq:sehatjoint}\end{equation} Substituting (\@ref(eq:Dhatmu)) and (\@ref(eq:seD2)) into
the general formula (\@ref(eq:tma)) gives the **two-sample t-test statistic
for means** \begin{equation}t=
\frac{\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}}
{\hat{\sigma}\, \sqrt{1/n_{2}+1/n_{1}}}
\label{eq:ztestmuDb}\end{equation} where $\hat{\sigma}$ is given by (\@ref(eq:sehatjoint)).

For an illustration of the calculations, consider again the housework
Example 7.2. Here, denoting men by 1 and women by 2, $n_{1}=635$,
$n_{2}=469$, $\bar{Y}_{1}=7.33$, $\bar{Y}_{2}=8.49$, $s_{1}=5.53$ and
$s_{2}=6.14$. The estimated mean difference is thus
$$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}=8.49-7.33=1.16.$$ The common
value of the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is estimated from
(\@ref(eq:sehatjoint)) as $$\begin{aligned}
\hat{\sigma}&=&
\sqrt{\frac{(n_{2}-1)s^{2}_{2}+(n_{1}-1)s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}}
=
\sqrt{\frac{(469-1) 6.14^{2}+(635-1) 5.53^{2}}{635+469-2}}\\
&=& \sqrt{33.604}=5.797\end{aligned}$$ and the estimated standard error
of $\hat{\Delta}$ is given by (\@ref(eq:seD2)) as
$$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}} =
\hat{\sigma} \; \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{2}}+\frac{1}{n_{1}}}
=5.797 \; \sqrt{\frac{1}{469}+\frac{1}{635}}=0.353.$$ The value of the
t-test statistic (\@ref(eq:ztestmuDb)) is then obtained as
$$t=\frac{1.16}{0.353}=3.29.$$ These values and other quantities
explained later, as well as similar results for Example 7.3, are also
shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-2testsY1).

  :(\#tab:t-2testsY1)Results of tests and confidence intervals for comparing means for
  two independent samples. For Example 7.2, the difference of means is
  between women and men, and for Example 7.3, it is between wearing and
  not wearing sunglasses. The test statistics and confidence intervals
  are obtained under the assumption of equal population standard
  deviations, and the $P$-values are for a test with a two-sided
  alternative hypothesis. See the text for the definitions of the
  statistics.

\label{p-spss2a} If necessary, calculations like these can be carried
out even with a pocket calculator. It is, however, much more convenient
to leave them to statistical software. Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test) shows
SPSS output for the two-sample t-test for the housework data. The first
part of the table, labelled “Group Statistics”, shows the sample sizes
$n$, means $\bar{Y}$ and standard deviations $s$ separately for the two
groups. The quantity labelled “Std. Error Mean” is $s/\sqrt{n}$. This is
an estimate of the standard error of the sample mean, which is the
quantity $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ discussed in Section \@ref(s-contd-clt).

The second part of the table in Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test), labelled
“Independent Samples Test”, gives results for the t-test itself. The
test considered here, which assumes a common population standard
deviation $\sigma$ (and thus also variance $\sigma^{2}$), is found on
the row labelled “Equal variances assumed”. The test statistic is shown
in the column labelled “$t$”, and the difference
$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}$ and its standard error
$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}$ are shown in the “Mean Difference” and
“Std. Error Difference” columns respectively. Note that the difference
($-1.16$) has been calculated in SPSS between men and women rather than
vice versa as in Table \@ref(tab:t-2testsY1), but this will make no
difference to the conclusions from the test.

![(\#fig:f-spss2test)SPSS output for a two-sample $t$-test in Example 7.2, comparing average weekly hours spent on housework between men and women.](spss2t){width="17cm"}

In the two-sample situation with assumptions 1–4 at the beginning of Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-intro), the sampling distribution of the t-test
statistic (\@ref(eq:ztestmuDb)) is approximately a standard normal
distribution when the null hypothesis
$H_{0}: \; \Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}=0$ is true in the population and the
sample sizes are large enough. This is again a consequence of the
Central Limit Theorem. The requirement for “large enough” sample sizes
is fairly easy to satisfy. A good rule of thumb is that the sample sizes
$n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ in the two groups should both be at least 20 for the
sampling distribution of the test statistic to be well enough
approximated by the standard normal distribution. In the housework
example we have data on 635 men and 469 women, so the sample sizes are
clearly large enough. A variant of the test which relaxes the condition
on the sample sizes is discussed in Section
\@ref(ss-means-inference-variants) below.

The $P$-value of the test is calculated from this sampling distribution
in exactly the same way as for the tests of proportions in Section
\@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd). In the housework example the value
of the $t$-test statistic is $t=3.29$. The $P$-value for testing the
null hypothesis against the two-sided alternative (\@ref(eq:Hatwom)) is then
the probability, calculated from the standard normal distribution, of
values that are at least 3.29 or at most $-3.29$. Each of these two
probabilities is about 0.0005, so the $P$-value is
$0.0005+0.0005=0.001$. In the SPSS output of Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test) it
is given in the column labelled “Sig. (2-tailed)”, where “Sig.” is short
for “significance” and “2-tailed” is a synonym for “2-sided”.

The $P$-value can also be calculated approximately using the table of
the standard normal distribution (see Table \@ref(tab:t-ttable), as explained in Section
\@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd). Here the test statistic $t=3.29$,
which is larger than the critical values 1.65, 1.96 and 2.58 for the
0.10, 0.05 and 0.01 significance levels for a two-sided test, so we can
report that $P<0.01$. Here $t$ is by chance actually equal (to two
decimal places) to the critical value for the 0.001 significance level,
so we could also report $P=0.001$. These findings agree, as they should,
with the exact $P$-value of 0.001 shown in the SPSS output.

In conclusion, the two-sample $t$-test in Example 7.2 indicates that
there is very strong evidence (with $P=0.001$ for the two-sided test)
against the claim that the hours of weekly housework are on average the
same for men and women in the population.

Here we showed raw SPSS output in Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test) because we
wanted to explain its contents and format. Note, however, that such
unedited computer output is rarely if ever appropriate in research
reports. Instead, results of statistical analyses should be given in
text or tables formatted in appropriate ways for presentation. See Table
\@ref(tab:t-2testsY1) and various other examples in this coursepack and
textbooks on statistics.

To summarise the elements of the test again, we repeat them briefly, now
for Example 7.3, the experiment on the effect of eye contact on the
perceived friendliness of police officers (c.f. Table \@ref(tab:t-groupex) for the summary statistics):

1.  Data: samples from two groups, one with the experimental condition
    where the officer wore no sunglasses, with sample size $n_{1}=67$,
    mean $\bar{Y}_{1}=8.23$ and standard deviation $s_{1}=2.39$, and the
    second with the experimental condition where the officer did wear
    sunglasses, with $n_{2}=66$, $\bar{Y}_{2}=6.49$ and $s_{2}=2.01$.

2.  Assumptions: the observations are random samples of statistically
    independent observations from two populations, one with mean
    $\mu_{1}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{1}$, and the other with
    with mean $\mu_{2}$ and the same standard deviation $\sigma_{2}$,
    where the standard deviations are equal, with value
    $\sigma=\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}$. The sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$
    are sufficiently large, say both at least 20, for the sampling
    distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis to be
    approximately standard normal.

3.  Hypotheses: These are about the difference of the population means
    $\Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}$, with null hypothesis $H_{0}: \Delta=0$.
    The two-sided alternative hypothesis $H_{a}: \Delta\ne 0$ is
    considered in this example.

4.  The test statistic: the two-sample $t$-statistic
    $$t=\frac{\hat{\Delta}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}}=
    \frac{-1.74}{0.383}=-4.55$$ where
    $$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}=6.49-8.23=-1.74$$ and
    $$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=
    \hat{\sigma} \; \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{2}}+\frac{1}{n_{1}}}
    =2.210 \times \sqrt{
    \frac{1}{66}+\frac{1}{67}}=0.383$$ with $$\hat{\sigma}=
    \sqrt{\frac{(n_{2}-1)s^{2}_{2}+(n_{1}-1)s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}+n_{2}-2}}
    =
    \sqrt{\frac{65\times 2.01^{2}+66\times 2.39^{2}}{131}}
    =2.210$$

5.  The sampling distribution of the test statistic when $H_{0}$ is
    true: approximately the standard normal distribution.

6.  The $P$-value: the probability that a randomly selected value from
    the standard normal distribution is at most $-4.55$ or at least
    4.55, which is about 0.000005 (reported as $P<0.001$).

7.  Conclusion: A two-sample $t$-test indicates very strong evidence
    that the average perceived level of the friendliness of a police
    officer is different when the officer is wearing reflective
    sunglasses than when the officer is not wearing such glasses
    ($P<0.001$).

### Confidence intervals for a difference of two means {#ss-means-inference-ci}

A confidence interval for the mean difference $\Delta=\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}$
is obtained by substituting appropriate expressions into the general
formula (\@ref(eq:ciDpa)). Specifically, here
$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}$ and a 95% confidence interval for
$\Delta$ is \begin{equation}(\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}) \pm 1.96\;  \hat{\sigma} \;
\sqrt{
\frac{1}{n_{2}}+\frac{1}{n_{1}}
}
\label{eq:ciDmu2}\end{equation} where $\hat{\sigma}$ is obtained from equation
\@ref(eq:sehatjoint). The validity of this again requires that the sample
sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ from both groups are reasonably large, say
both at least 20. For the housework Example 7.2, the 95% confidence
interval is $$1.16\pm 1.96\times 0.353 = 1.16 \pm 0.69 = (0.47; 1.85)$$
using the values of $\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}$ and its standard error
calculated earlier. This interval is also shown in Table
\@ref(tab:t-2testsY1)  and in the SPSS output in
Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test) \label{p-spss2c}.
In the latter, the interval is given as (-1.85; -0.47) because it is
expressed for the difference defined in the opposite direction (men $-$
women instead of vice versa). For Example 7.3, the 95% confidence
interval is $-1.74\pm 1.96\times 0.383=(-2.49;
-0.99)$.

Based on the data in Example 7.2 we are thus 95 % confident that the
difference between women’s and men’s average hours of reported weekly
housework in the population is between 0.47 and 1.85 hours. In
substantive terms this interval, from just under half an hour to nearly
two hours, is arguably fairly wide in that its two end points might well
be regarded as substantially different from each other. The difference
between women’s and men’s average housework hours is thus estimated
fairly imprecisely from this survey.

### Variants of the test and confidence interval {#ss-means-inference-variants}

#### Allowing unequal population variances {-}

The two-sample $t$-test and confidence interval for the difference of
means were stated above under the assumption that the standard
deviations $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ of the variable of interest $Y$
are the same in both of the two groups being compared. This assumption
is not in fact essential. If it is omitted, we obtain formulas which
differ from the ones discussed above only in one part of the
calculations.

Suppose that we do allow the unknown values of $\sigma_{1}$ and
$\sigma_{2}$ to be different from each other. In other words, we
consider the model stated at the beginning of Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-intro), without
assumption 4 that $\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}$. The test statistic is then
still of the same form as before,
i.e. $t=\hat{\Delta}/\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}$, with
$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}$. The only change in the
calculations is that the estimate of the standard error of
$\hat{\Delta}$, the formula of which is given by equation
(\@ref(eq:sigmaDmu)), now uses separate estimates
of $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$. The obvious choices for these are the
corresponding sample standard deviations, $s_{1}$ for $\sigma_{1}$ and
$s_{2}$ for $\sigma_{2}$. This gives the estimated standard error as
\begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=
\sqrt{
\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}+
\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}
}.
\label{eq:seDmu-ne}\end{equation} Substituting this to the formula of the test
statistic yields the two-sample $t$-test statistic without the
assumption of equal population standard deviations, \begin{equation}t=
\frac{\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}}
{\sqrt{s^{2}_{2}/n_{2}+s^{2}_{1}/n_{1}}}.
\label{eq:ztestmuD}\end{equation} The sampling distribution of this under the null
hypothesis is again approximately a standard normal distribution when
the sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are both at least 20. The $P$-value
for the test is obtained in exactly the same way as before, and the
principles of interpreting the result of the test are also unchanged.

For the confidence interval, the only change from Section
\@ref(ss-means-inference-ci) is again that the estimated standard error
is changed, so for a 95% confidence interval we use
\begin{equation}(\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}) \pm 1.96 \;
\sqrt{
\frac{s^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}+\frac{s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}}
}.
\label{eq:ciDmu}\end{equation}

In the housework example 7.2, the estimated standard error
(\@ref(eq:seDmu-ne)) is $$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=
\sqrt{
\frac{6.14^{2}}{469}+
\frac{5.53^{2}}{635}
}=
\sqrt{0.1285}=0.359,$$ the value of the test statistic is
$$t=\frac{1.16}{0.359}=3.23,$$ and the two-sided $P$-value is now
$P=0.001$. Recall that when the population standard deviations were
assumed to be equal, we obtained $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=0.353$,
$t=3.29$ and again $P=0.001$. The two sets of results are thus very
similar, and the conclusions from the test are the same in both cases.
The differences between the two variants of the test are even smaller in
Example 7.3, where the estimated standard error
$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=0.383$ is the same (to three decimal
places) in both cases, and the results are thus identical.^[In this case this is a consquence of the fact that the sample
sizes (67 and 66) in the two groups are very similar. When they are
exactly equal, formulas (\@ref(eq:sehatjoint))–(\@ref(eq:ztestmuDb)) and
(\@ref(eq:seDmu-ne)) actually give exactly the same value for the
standard error $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}$, and $t$ is thus also
the same for both variants of the test.] In both
examples the confidence intervals obtained from (\@ref(eq:ciDmu2)) and
(\@ref(eq:ciDmu)) are also very similar. Both variants of the two-sample
analyses are shown in SPSS output (c.f. Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test)), the ones assuming equal population standard
deviations on the row labelled “Equal variances assumed” and the one
without this assumption on the “Equal variances not assumed” row.^[The output also shows, under “Levene’s test”, a test statistic and
$P$-value for testing the hypothesis of equal standard deviations
($H_{0}: \,
\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}$). However, we prefer not to rely on this
because the test requires the additional assumption that the
population distributions are normal, and is very sensitive to the
correctness of this assumption.]

Which methods should we then use, the ones with or without the
assumption of equal population variances? In practice the choice rarely
makes much difference, and the $P$-values and conclusions from the two
versions of the test are typically very similar.^[In the MY464 examination and homework, for example, both variants
of the test are equally acceptable, unless a question explicitly
states otherwise.] Not assuming the
variances to be equal has the advantage of making fewer restrictive
assumptions about the population. For this reason it should be used in
the rare cases where the $P$-values obtained under the different
assumptions are substantially different. This version of the test
statistic is also slightly easier to calculate by hand, since
(\@ref(eq:seDmu-ne)) is a slightly simpler formula than
(\@ref(eq:seD2))–(\@ref(eq:sehatjoint)). On the other hand, the test statistic
which does assume equal standard deviations has the advantage that it is
more closely related to analogous tests used in more general contexts
(especially the method of linear regression modelling, discussed in
Chapter \@ref(c-regression)). It is also preferable when the sample sizes
are very small, as discussed below.

#### Using the $t$ distribution {-}

As discussed in Section \@ref(s-contd-probdistrs), it is often assumed
that the population distributions of the variables under consideration
are described by particular probability distributions. In this chapter,
however, such assumptions have so far been avoided. This is a
consequence of the Central Limit Theorem, which ensures that as long as
the sample sizes are large enough, the sampling distribution of the
two-sample $t$-test statistic is approximately the standard normal
distribution, irrespective of the forms of the population distributions
of $Y$ in the two groups. In this section we briefly describe variants
of the test and confidence interval which *do* assume that the
population distributions are of a particular form, specifically that
they are normal distributions. This changes the sampling distribution
that is used for the test statistic and for the multiplier of the
confidence interval, but the analyses are otherwise unchanged.

For the significance test, there are again two variants depending on the
assumptions about the the population standard deviations $\sigma_{1}$
and $\sigma_{2}$. Consider first the case where these are assumed to be
equal. The sampling distribution is then given by the following result,
which now holds for *any* sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$:

-   In the two-sample situation specified by assumptions 1–4 at the beginning of Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-intro) (including the assumption of equal population
    standard deviations, $\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}=\sigma$), and if also
    the distribution of $Y$ is a normal distribution in both groups, the
    sampling distribution of the t-test statistic (\@ref(eq:ztestmuDb)) is a
    $t$ distribution with $n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ degrees of freedom when the
    null hypothesis $H_{0}: \;
    \Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}=0$ is true in the population.

The $\mathbf{t}$ **distributions** mentioned in this result are a family
of distributions with different degrees of freedom, in a similar way as
the $\chi^{2}$ distributions discussed in Section
\@ref(ss-tables-chi2test-sdist). All $t$ distributions are symmetric
around 0. Their shape is quite similar to that of the standard normal
distribution, except that the variance of a $t$ distribution is somewhat
larger and its tails thus heavier. The difference is noticeable only
when the degrees of freedom are small, as seen in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-tdistr1). This shows the curves for the $t$ distributions with 6
and 30 degrees of freedom, compared to the standard normal distribution.
It can be seen that the $t_{30}$ distribution is already very similar to
the $N(0,1)$ distribution. With degrees of freedom larger than about 30,
the difference becomes almost indistinguishable.

![(\#fig:f-tdistr1)Curves of two $t$ distributions with small degrees of freedom, compared to the standard normal distribution.](tdistr1){width="13cm"}

If we use this result for the test, the $P$-value is obtained from the
$t$ distribution with $n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ degrees of freedom (often denoted
$t_{n1+n2-2}$). The principles of doing this are exactly the same as
those described in Section \@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd), and can
be graphically illustrated by plots similar to those in Figure
\@ref(fig:f-pval-prob). Precise $P$-values are
again obtained using a computer. In fact, $P$-values in SPSS output for
the two-sample $t$-test (c.f. Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test)) are actually those obtained from the $t$
distribution (with the degrees of freedom shown in the column labelled
“df”) rather than the standard normal distribution. Differences between
the two are, however, very small if the sample sizes are even moderately
large, because then the degrees of freedom $df=n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ are large
enough for the two distributions to be virtually identical. This is the
case, for instance, in both of the examples considered so far in this
chapter, where $df=1102$ in Example 7.2 and $df=131$ in Example 7.3.

If precise $P$-values from the $t$ distribution are not available, upper
bounds for them can again be obtained using appropriate tables, in the
same way as in Section \@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd). Now,
however, the critical values depend also on the degrees of freedom.
Because of this, introductory text books on statistics typically include
a table of critical values for $t$ distributions for a selection of
degrees of freedom. A table of this kind is shown in the Appendix at the end of this course pack. Each row of the
table corresponds to a $t$ distribution with the degrees of freedom
given in the column labelled “df”. As here, such tables typically
include all degrees of freedom between 1 and 30, plus a selection of
larger values, here 40, 60 and 120.

The last row is labelled “$\infty$”, the mathematical symbol for
infinity. This corresponds to the standard normal distribution, as a $t$
distribution with infinite degrees of freedom is equal to the standard
normal. The practical implication of this is that the standard normal
distribution is a good enough approximation for any $t$ distribution
with reasonably large degrees of freedom. The table thus lists
individual degrees of freedom only up to some point, and the last row
will be used for any values larger than this. For degrees of freedom
between two values shown in the table (e.g. 50 when only 40 and 60 are
given), it is best to use the values for the nearest available degrees
of freedom *below* the required ones (e.g. use 40 for 50). This will
give a “conservative” approximate $P$-value which may be slightly larger
than the exact value.

As for the standard normal distribution, the table is used to identify
critical values for different significance levels (c.f. the information
in Table \@ref(tab:t-ttable)). For example, if the degrees of freedom are 20,
the critical value for two-sided tests at the significance level 0.05 in
the “0.025” column on the row labelled “20”. This is 2.086. In general,
critical values for $t$ distributions are somewhat larger than
corresponding values for the standard normal distribution, but the
difference between the two is quite small when the degrees of freedom
are reasonably large.

The $t$-test and the $t$ distribution are among the oldest tools of
statistical inference. They were introduced in 1908 by W. S. Gosset,^[Student (1908). “The probable error of a mean”. *Biometrika*
**6**, 1–25.]
initially for the one-sample case discussed in Section
\@ref(s-means-1sample). Gosset was working as a chemist at the Guinness
brewery at St. James’ Gate, Dublin. He published his findings under the
pseudonym “Student”, and the distribution is often known as *Student’s
$t$ distribution*.

These results for the sampling distribution hold when the population
standard deviations $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ are assumed to be
equal. If this assumption is not made, the test statistic is again
calculated using formulas (\@ref(eq:seDmu-ne)) and (\@ref(eq:ztestmuD)). This case is mathematically more difficult than the
previous one, because the sampling distribution of the test statistic
under the null hypothesis is then not exactly a $t$ distribution even
when the population distributions are normal. One way of dealing with
this complication (which is known as the Behrens–Fisher problem) is to
find a $t$ distribution which is a good approximation of the true
sampling distribution. The degrees of freedom of this approximating
distribution are given by \begin{equation}df=\frac{\left(
\frac{s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}}+
\frac{s^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}
\right)^{2}}
{
\left(\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}\right)^{2}\;
\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}-1}\right)
+
\left(\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}\right)^{2}\;
\left(\frac{1}{n_{2}-1}\right)
}.
\label{eq:satter-df}\end{equation} This formula, which is known as the
Welch-Satterthwaite approximation, is not particularly interesting or
worth learning in itself. It is presented here purely for completeness,
and to give an idea of how the degrees of freedom given in the SPSS
output are obtained. In Example 7.2 (see Figure \@ref(fig:f-spss2test)) these degrees of freedom are 945.777,
showing that the approximate degrees of freedom from (\@ref(eq:satter-df))
are often not whole numbers. If approximate $P$-values are then obtained
from a $t$-table, we need to use values for the nearest whole-number
degrees of freedom shown in the table. This problem does not arise if
the calculations are done with a computer.

Two sample $t$-test statistics (in two variants, under equal and unequal
population standard deviations) have now been defined under two
different sets of assumptions about the population distributions. In
each case, the formula of the test statistic is the same, so the only
difference is in the form of its sampling distribution under the null
hypothesis. If the population distributions of $Y$ in the two groups are
assumed to be normal, the sampling distribution of the $t$-statistic is
a $t$ distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom. If the sample
sizes are reasonably large, the sampling distribution is approximately
standard normal, whatever the shape of the population distribution.
Which set of assumptions should we then use? The following guidelines
can be used to make the choice:

-   The easiest and arguably most common case is the one where both
    sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are large enough (both greater than
    20, say) for the standard normal approximation of the sampling
    distribution to be reasonably accurate. Because the degrees of
    freedom of the appropriate $t$ distribution are then also large, the
    two sampling distributions are very similar, and conclusions from
    the test will be similar in either case. It is then purely a matter
    of convenience which sampling distribution is used:

    -   If you use a computer (e.g. SPSS) to carry out the test or you
        are (e.g. in an exam) given computer output, use the $P$-value
        in the output. This will be from the $t$ distribution.

    -   If you need to calculate the test statistic by hand and thus
        need to use tables of critical values to draw the conclusion,
        use the critical values for the standard normal distribution
        (see Table \@ref(tab:t-ttable)).

-   When the sample sizes are small (e.g. if one or both of them are
    less than 20), only the $t$ distribution can be used, and even then
    only if $Y$ is approximately normally distributed in both groups in
    the population. For some variables (say weight or blood pressure) we
    might have some confidence that this is the case, perhaps from
    previous, larger studies. In other cases the normality of $Y$ can
    only be assessed based on its sample distribution, which of course
    is not very informative when the sample is small. In most cases,
    some doubt will remain, so the results of a $t$-test from small
    samples should be treated with caution. An alternative is then to
    use *nonparametric* tests which avoid the assumption of normality,
    for example the so-called Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. These,
    however, are not covered on this course.

There are also situations where the population distribution of $Y$
cannot possibly be normal, so the possibility of referring to a $t$
distribution does not arise. One example are the tests on population
proportions that were discussed in Chapter \@ref(c-probs). There the only
possibility we discussed was to use the approximate standard normal
sampling distribution, as long as the sample sizes were large enough.
Because the $t$-distribution is never relevant there, the test statistic
is conventionally called the $z$-test statistic rather than $t$.
Sometimes the label $z$ instead of $t$ is used also for two-sample
$t$-statistics described in this chapter. This does not change the test
itself.

It is also possible to obtain a confidence interval for $\Delta$ which
is valid for even very small sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, but only
under the further assumption that the population distribution of $Y$ in
both groups is normal. This affects only the multiplier of the standard
errors, which is now based on a $t$ distribution. The appropriate
degrees of freedom are again $df=n_{1}+n_{2}-2$ when the population
standard deviations are assumed equal, and approximately given by
equation (\@ref(eq:satter-df)) if not. In this case the multiplier in
(\@ref(eq:ciDpa)) may be labelled $t^{(df)}_{\alpha/2}$ instead of
$z_{\alpha/2}$ to draw attention to the fact that it comes from a
$t$-distribution and depends on the degrees of freedom $df$ as well as
the significance level $1-\alpha$.

Any multiplier $t_{\alpha/2}^{(df)}$ is obtained from the relevant $t$
distribution using exactly the same logic as the one explained for the
normal distribution in the previous section, using a computer or a table
of $t$ distributions. For example, in the $t$ table in the Appendix, multipliers for a 95% confidence interval are
the numbers given in the column labelled “0.025”. Suppose, for instance,
that the sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are both 10 and population
standard deviations are assumed equal, so that $df=10+10-2=18$. The
table shows that a $t$-based 95% confidence interval would then use the
multiplier 2.101. This is somewhat larger than the corresponding
multiplier 1.96 from the normal distribution, and the $t$-based interval
is somewhat wider than one based on the normal distribution. The
difference between the two becomes very small when the sample sizes are
even moderately large, because then $df$ is large and
$t_{\alpha/2}^{(df)}$ is very close to 1.96.

The choice between confidence intervals based on the normal or a $t$
distribution involves the same considerations as for the significance
test. In short, if the sample sizes are not very small, the choice makes
little difference and can be based on convenience. If you are
calculating an interval by hand, a normal-based one is easier to use
because the multiplier (e.g. 1.96 for 95% intervals) does not depend on
the sample sizes. If, instead, a computer is used, it typically gives
confidence intervals for differences of means based on the $t$
distribution, so these are easier to use. Finally, if one or both of the
sample sizes are small, only $t$-based intervals can safely be used, and
then only if you are confident that the population distributions of $Y$
are approximately normal.

## Tests and confidence intervals for a single mean {#s-means-1sample}

The task considered in this section is inference on the population mean
of a continuous, interval-level variable $Y$ in a single population.
This is thus analogous to the analysis of a single proportion in
Sections \@ref(s-probs-test1sample)–\@ref(s-probs-1sampleci), but with a
continuous variable of interest.

We use Example 7.1 on survey data on diet for illustration. We will
consider two variables, daily consumption of portions of fruit and
vegetables, and the percentage of total faily energy intake obtained
from fat and fatty acids. These will be analysed separately, each in
turn in the role of the variable of interest $Y$. Summary statistics for
the variables are shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-ttests1)

  :(\#tab:t-ttests1)Summary statistics, $t$-tests and confidence intervals for the mean
  for the two variables in Example 7.1 (variables from the Diet and
  Nutrition Survey). $n=$sample size; $\bar{Y}=$sample mean; $s=$sample standard
  deviation; $\mu_{0}=$null hypothesis about the population mean; $t=t$-test
  statistic; $*$: Alternative hypothesis $H_{a}: \mu\ne \mu_{0}$; $\dagger$:
  Alternative hypotheses $H_{a}: \mu<5$ and $\mu>35$ respectively.

The setting for the analysis of this section is summarised as a
statistical model for observations of a variable $Y$ as follows:

1.  The population distribution of $Y$ has some unknown mean $\mu$ and
    unknown standard deviation $\sigma$.

2.  The observations $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \dots, Y_{n}$ in the sample are a
    random sample from the population.

3.  The observations are statistically independent, as discussed at the beginning of Section \@ref(ss-means-inference-intro).

It is not necessary to assume that the population distribution has a
particular form. However, this is again sometimes assumed to be a normal
distribution, in which case the analyses may be modified in ways
discussed below.

The only quantity of interest considered here is $\mu$, the population
mean of $Y$. In the diet examples this is the mean number of portions of
fruit and vegetables, or mean percentage of energy derived from fat
(both on an average day for an individual) among the members of the
population (which for this survey is British adults aged 19–64).

Because no separate groups are being compared, questions of interest are
now not about differences between different group means, but about the
value of $\mu$ itself. The best single estimate (*point estimate*) of
$\mu$ is the sample mean $\bar{Y}$. More information is provided by a
confidence interval which shows which values of $\mu$ are plausible
given the observed data.

Significance testing focuses on the question of whether it is plausible
that the true value of $\mu$ is equal to a particular value $\mu_{0}$
specified by the researcher. The specific value of $\mu_{0}$ to be
tested is suggested by the research questions. For example, we will
consider $\mu_{0}=5$ for portions of fruit and vegetables and
$\mu_{0}=35$ for the percentage of energy from fat. These values are
chosen because they correspond to recommendations by the Department of
Health that we should consume at least 5 portions of fruit and
vegetables a day, and that fat should contribute no more than 35% of
total energy intake. The statistical question is thus whether the
average level of consumption in the population is at the recommended
level.

In this setting, the null hypothesis for a significance test will be of
the form \begin{equation}H_{0}: \; \mu=\mu_{0},
\label{eq:H01}\end{equation} i.e. it claims that the unknown population mean $\mu$ is
equal to the value $\mu_{0}$ specified by the null hypothesis. This will
be tested against the two-sided alternative hypothesis
\begin{equation}H_{a}: \; \mu\ne \mu_{0}
\label{eq:Ha1two}\end{equation} or one of the one-sided alternative hypotheses
\begin{equation}H_{a}:  \mu> \mu_{0} \label{eq:Ha1onegt}\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}H_{a}:  \mu< \mu_{0}.\label{eq:Ha1onelt}\end{equation}
For example, we might consider the one-sided alternative hypotheses $H_{a}:\; \mu<5$ for portions of fruit and vegetables and $H_{a}:\;\mu>35$ for the percentage of energy from fat. For both of these, the
alternative corresponds to a difference from $\mu_{0}$ in the unhealthy
direction, i.e. less fruit and vegetables and more fat than are
recommended.

To establish a connection to the general formulas that have been stated
previously, it is again useful to express these hypotheses in terms of
\begin{equation}\Delta=\mu-\mu_{0},\label{eq:D1mu}\end{equation}
i.e. the difference between the unknown true mean $\mu$
and the value $\mu_{0}$ claimed by the null hypothesis. Because this is
0 if and only if $\mu$ and $\mu_{0}$ are equal, the null hypothesis
(\@ref(eq:H01)) can also be expressed as
\begin{equation}H_{0}: \; \Delta=0,\label{eq:H0D}\end{equation}
and possible alternative hypotheses as
\begin{equation}H_{0}: \Delta\ne0, \label{eq:HaDtwo}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}H_{0}: \Delta>0 \label{eq:HaDonegt}\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}H_{0}:  \Delta< 0,   \label{eq:HaDonelt}\end{equation}
corresponding to
(\@ref(eq:Ha1two)), (\@ref(eq:Ha1onegt)) and (\@ref(eq:Ha1onelt)) respectively.

The general formulas summarised in Section
\@ref(ss-means-inference-intro) can again be used, as long as their
details are modified to apply to $\Delta$ defined as $\mu-\mu_{0}$. The
resulting formulas are listed briefly below, and then illustrated using
the data from the diet survey:

-   The point estimate of the difference $\Delta=\mu-\mu_{0}$ is
    \begin{equation}\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}-\mu_{0}.
    \label{eq:Dhat1}\end{equation}

-   The standard error of $\hat{\Delta}$, i.e. the standard deviation of
    its sampling distribution, is
    $\sigma_{\hat{\Delta}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ (note that this is equal to
    the standard error $\sigma_{\bar{Y}}$ of the sample mean $\bar{Y}$
    itself).^[The two are the same because $\mu_{0}$ in
    $\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}-\mu_{0}$ is a known number rather a
    data-dependent statistic, which means that it does not affect the
    standard error.] This is estimated by
    \begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}.
    \label{eq:seDhat1}\end{equation}

-   The $t$-test statistic for testing the null hypothesis (\@ref(eq:H0D))
    is \begin{equation}t=\frac{\hat{\Delta}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}} =
    \frac{\bar{Y}-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}}.
    \label{eq:tD1}\end{equation}

-   The sampling distribution of the $t$-statistic, when the null
    hypothesis is true, is approximately a standard normal distribution,
    when the sample size $n$ is reasonably large. A common rule of thumb
    is that this sampling distribution is adequate when $n$ is at
    least 30.

    -   Alternatively, we may make the further assumption that the
        population distribution of $Y$ is normal, in which case no
        conditions on $n$ are required. The sampling distribution of $t$
        is then a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. The
        choice of which sampling distribution to refer to is based on
        the considerations outlined in Section
        \@ref(ss-means-inference-variants). When $n$ is 30 or larger, the
        two approaches give very similar results.

-   $P$-values are obtained and the conclusions drawn in the same way as
    for two-sample tests, with appropriate modifications to the wording
    of the conclusions.

-   A confidence interval for $\Delta$, with confidence level $1-\alpha$
    and based on the approximate normal sampling distribution, is given
    by \begin{equation}\hat{\Delta}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\, \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}
    =
    (\bar{Y}-\mu_{0}) \pm z_{\alpha/2} \, \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
    \label{eq:ciD1}\end{equation} where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the multiplier from the
    standard normal distribution for the required significance level
    (see Table \@ref(tab:t-ciq)), most often 1.96 for
    a 95% confidence interval. If an interval based on the $t$
    distribution is wanted instead, $z_{\alpha/2}$ is replaced by the
    corresponding multiplier $t_{\alpha/2}^{(n-1)}$ from the
    $t_{n-1}$ distribution.

    Instead of the interval (\@ref(eq:ciD1)) for the difference
    $\Delta=\mu-\mu_{0}$, it is usually more sensible to report a
    confidence interval for $\mu$ itself. This is given by
    \begin{equation}\bar{Y} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \, \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},
    \label{eq:cimu1}\end{equation} which is obtained by adding $\mu_{0}$ to both end
    points of (\@ref(eq:ciD1)).

For the fruit and vegetable variable in the diet example, the mean under
the null hypothesis is the dietary recommendation $\mu_{0}=5$. The
estimated difference (\@ref(eq:Dhat1)) is $$\hat{\Delta}=2.8-5=-2.2$$ and
its estimated standard error (\@ref(eq:seDhat1)) is
$$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}= \frac{2.15}{\sqrt{1724}} = 0.05178,$$ so
the $t$-test statistic (\@ref(eq:tD1)) is
$$t=\frac{-2.2}{0.05178} = -42.49.$$ To obtain the $P$-value for the
test, $t=-42.49$ is referred to the sampling distribution under the null
hypothesis, which can here be taken to be the standard normal
distribution, as the sample size $n=1723$ is large. If we consider the
two-sided alternative hypothesis $H_{a}:\; \Delta\ne 0$ (i.e. $H_{a}:\;
\mu\ne5$), the $P$-value is the probability that a randomly selected
value from the standard normal distribution is at most $-42.49$ or at
least 42.49. This is a very small probability, approximately
$0.00\cdots019$, with 268 zeroes between the decimal point and the 1.
This is, of course, to all practical purposes zero, and can be reported
as $P<0.001$. The null hypothesis $H_{0}:\; \mu=5$ is rejected at any
conventional level of significance. A $t$-test for the mean indicates
very strong evidence that the average daily number of portions of fruit
and vegetables consumed by members of the population differs from the
recommended minimum of five.

If we considered instead the one-sided alternative hypothesis $H_{a}:\;\Delta<0$ (i.e. $H_{a}: \; \mu<5$), the observed sample mean
$\bar{Y}=2.8<5$ is in the direction of this alternative. The $P$-value
is then the one-sided $P$-value divided by 2, which is here a small
value reported as $P<0.001$ again. The null hypothesis $H_{0}: \; \mu=5$
(and by implication also the one-sided null hypothesis
$H_{0}:\; \mu\ge 5$, as discussed at the end of Section \@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-hypotheses)) is
thus also rejected in favour of this one-sided alternative, at any
conventional significance level.

A 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is obtained from (\@ref(eq:cimu1)) as
$$2.8\pm 1.96 \times \frac{2.15}{\sqrt{1724}}
=2.8\pm 1.96 \times 0.05178=
2.8\pm 0.10 = (2.70; 2.90).$$ We are thus 95% confident that the average
daily number of portions of fruit and vegetables consumed by members of
the population is between 2.70 and 2.90.

Figure \@ref(fig:f-spsstest) shows how these results for the fruit and
vegetable variable are displayed in SPSS output. The label “portions”
refers to the name given to the variable in the SPSS data file, and
“Test Value = 5” indicates the null hypothesis value $\mu_{0}$ being
tested. \label{p-ttest-expl}Other parts of the SPSS output correspond to
the information in Table \@ref(tab:t-ttests1) in fairly obvious ways, so “N”
indicates the sample size $n$ (and not a population size, which is
denoted by $N$ in our notation), “Mean” the sample mean $\bar{Y}$,
“Std. Deviation” the sample standard deviation $s$, “Std. Error Mean”
the estimate of the standard error of the mean given by
$s/\sqrt{n}=2.15/\sqrt{1724}=0.05178$, “Mean Difference” the difference
$\hat{\Delta}=\bar{Y}-\mu_{0}=2.8-5=-2.2$, and “t” the $t$-test
statistic (\@ref(eq:tD1)). The $P$-value against the two-sided alternative
hypothesis is shown as “Sig. (2-tailed)” (reported in the somewhat
sloppy SPSS manner as “.000”). This is actually obtained from the $t$
distribution, the degrees of freedom of which ($n-1=1723$) are given
under “df”. Finally, the output also contains a 95% confidence interval
for the difference $\Delta=\mu-\mu_{0}$, i.e. the interval
(\@ref(eq:ciD1)).^[Except that SPSS uses the multiplier from $t_{1723}$ distribution
rather than the normal distribution. This makes no difference here,
as the former is 1.961 and the latter 1.960.] This is given as $(-2.30; -2.10)$. To obtain the more
convenient confidence interval (\@ref(eq:cimu1)) for $\mu$ itself, we only
need to add $\mu_{0}=5$ to both end points of the interval shown by
SPSS, to obtain $(-2.30+5;
-2.10+5)=(2.70; 2.90)$ as before.

![(\#fig:f-spsstest)SPSS output for a $t$-test of a single mean. The output is for the variable on fruit and vegetable consumption in Table \@ref(tab:t-ttests1), with the null hypothesis $H-{0}: \mu=5$.](ttestspss){width="130mm"}

Similar results for the variable on the percentage of dietary energy
obtained from fat are also shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-ttests1). Here
$\mu_{0}=35$, $\hat{\Delta}=35.3-35=0.3$,
$\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=6.11/\sqrt{1724}=0.147$, $t=0.3/0.147$, and
the two-sided $P$-value is $P=0.042$. Here $P<0.05$, so null hypothesis
that the population average of the percentage of energy obtained from
fat is 35 is rejected at the 5% level of significance. However, because
$P>0.01$, the hypothesis would not be rejected at the next conventional
significance level of 1%. The conclusions are the same if we considered
the one-sided alternative hypothesis $H_{a}:\; \mu>35$, for which
$P=0.042/2=0.021$ (as the observed sample mean $\bar{Y}=35.3$ is in the
direction of $H_{a}$). In this case the evidence against the null
hypothesis is thus somewhat less strong than for the fruit and vegetable
variable, for which the $P$-value was extremely small. The 95%
confidence interval for the population average of the fat variable is
$35.3\pm 1.96\times 0.147=(35.01; 35.59)$.

Analysis of a single population mean is a good illustration of some of
the advantages of confidence intervals over significance tests. First, a
confidence interval provides a summary of all the plausible values of
$\mu$ even when, as is very often the case, there is no obvious single
value $\mu_{0}$ to be considered as the null hypothesis of the
one-sample $t$-test. Second, even when such a significance test is
sensible, the conclusion can also be obtained from the confidence
interval, as discussed at the end of Section \@ref(ss-means-ci-vstests). In other words,
$H_{0}:\;
\mu=\mu_{0}$ is rejected at a given significance level against a
two-sided alternative hypothesis, if the confidence interval for $\mu$
at the corresponding confidence level does not contain $\mu_{0}$, and
not rejected if the interval contains $\mu_{0}$. Here the 95% confidence
interval (2.70; 2.90) does not contain 5 for the fruit and vegetable
variable, and the interval (35.01; 35.59) does not contain 35 for the
fat variable, so the null hypotheses with these values as $\mu_{0}$ are
rejected at the 5% level of significance.

The width of a confidence interval also gives information on how precise
the results of the statistical analysis are. Here the intervals seem
quite narrow for both variables, in that it seems that their end points
(e.g. 2.7 and 2.9 for portions of fruit and vegetables) would imply
qualitatively similar conclusions about the level of consumption in the
population. Analysis of the sample of 1724 respondents in the National
Diet and Nutrition Survey thus appears to have given us quite precise
information on the population averages for most practical purposes. Of
course, what is precise enough ultimately depends on what those purposes
are. If much higher precision was required, the sample size in the
survey would have to be correspondingly larger.

Finally, in cases where a null hypothesis is rejected by a significance
test, a confidence interval has the additional advantage of providing a
way to assess whether the observed deviation from the null hypothesis
seems large in some *substantive* sense. For example, the confidence
interval for the fat variable draws attention to the fact that the
evidence against a population mean of 35 is not very strong. The lower
bound of the interval is only 0.01 units above 35, which is very little
relative to the overall width (about 0.60) of the interval. The
$P$-value (0.041) of the test, which is not much below the reference
level of 0.05, also suggests this, but in a less obvious way. Even the
upper limit (35.59) of the interval is arguably not very far from 35, so
it suggests that we can be fairly confident that the population mean
does not differ from 35 by very much in the substantive sense. This
contrasts with the results for the fruit and vegetable variable, where
all the values covered by the confidence interval (2.70; 2.90) are much
more obviously far from the recommended value of 5.

## Inference for dependent samples {#s-means-dependent}

In the two-sample cases considered in Section \@ref(s-means-inference),
the two groups being compared consisted of separate and presumably
unrelated units (people, in all of these cases). It thus seemed
justified to treat the groups as statistically independent. The third
and last general case considered in this chapter is one where this
assumption cannot be made, because there are some obvious connections
between the groups. Examples 7.4 and 7.5 illustrate this situation. Specifically, in
both cases we can find for each observation in one group a natural
*pair* in the other group. In Example 7.4, the data consist of
observations of a variable for a group of fathers at two time points, so
the pairs of observations are clearly formed by the two measurements for
each father. In Example 7.5 the basic observations are for separate
days, but these are paired (*matched*) in that for each Friday the 13th
in one group, the preceding Friday the 6th is included in the other. In
both cases the existence of the pairings implies that we must treat the
two groups as statistically *dependent*.

Data with dependent samples are quite common, largely because they are
often very informative. Principles of good research design suggest that
one key condition for being able to make valid and powerful comparisons
between two groups is that the groups should be as similar as possible,
apart from differing in the characteristic being considered. Dependent
samples represent an attempt to achieve this through intelligent data
collection. In Example 7.4, the comparison of interest is between a
man’s sense of well-being before and after the birth of his first child.
It is likely that there are also other factors which affect well-being,
such as personality and life circumstances unrelated to the birth of a
child. Here, however, we can compare the well-being for the *same* men
before and after the birth, which should mean that many of those other
characteristics remain approximately unchanged between the two
measurements. Information on the effects of the birth of a child will
then mostly come not from overall levels of well-being but *changes* in
it for each man.

In Example 7.5, time of the year and day of the week are likely to have
a very strong effect on traffic levels. Comparing, say, Friday, November
13th to Friday, July 6th, let alone to Sunday, November 15th, would thus
not provide much information about possible additional differences which
were due specifically to a Friday being the 13th. To keep these other
characteristics approximately constant and thus to focus on the effects
of Friday the 13th, each such Friday has here been matched with the
nearest preceding Friday. With this design, data on just ten matched
pairs will (as seen below) allow us to conclude that the differences are
statistically significant.

Generalisations of the research designs illustrated by Examples 7.4 and
7.5 allow for measurements at more than two occasions for each subject
(so-called longitudinal or panel studies) and groups of more than two
matched units (clustered designs). Most of these are analysed using
statistical methods which are beyond the scope of this course. The
paired case is an exception, for which the analysis is in fact easier
than for two independent samples. This is because the pairing of
observations allows us to reduce the analysis into a one-sample problem,
simply by considering within-pair *differences* in the response variable
$Y$. Only the case where $Y$ is a continuous variable is considered
here. There are also methods of inference for comparing two (or more)
dependent samples of response variables of other types, but they are not
covered here.

The quantity of interest is again a population difference. This time it
can be formulated as $\Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}$, where $\mu_{1}$ is the
mean of $Y$ for the first group (e.g. the first time point in Example
7.4) and $\mu_{2}$ its mean for the second group. Methods of inference
for $\Delta$ will again be obtained using the same general results which
were previously applied to one-sample analyses and comparisons of two
independent samples. The easiest way to do this is now to consider a new
variable $D$, defined for each *pair* $i$ as $D_{i}=Y_{2i}-Y_{1i}$,
where $Y_{1i}$ denotes the value of the first measurement of $Y$ for
pair $i$, and $Y_{2i}$ is the second measurement of $Y$ for the same
pair. In Example 7.4 this is thus the difference between a man’s
well-being after the birth of his first baby, and the same man’s
well-being before the birth. In Example 7.5, $D$ is the difference in
traffic flows on a stretch of motorway between a Friday the 13th and the
Friday a week earlier (these values are shown in the last column of
Table \@ref(tab:t-F13)). The number of observations of $D$ is the number of
pairs, which is equal to the sample sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ in each of
the two groups (the case where one of the two measurements might be
missing for some pairs is not considered here). We will denote it by
$n$.

The population mean of the differences $D$ is also
$\Delta=\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}$, so the observed values $D_{i}$ can be used for
inference on $\Delta$. An estimate of $\Delta$ is the sample average of
$D_{i}$,
i.e. \begin{equation}\hat{\Delta}=\overline{D}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_{i}.
\label{eq:Dbar-dep}\end{equation} In other words, this is the average of the
within-pair differences between the two measurements of $Y$. Its
standard error is estimated by \begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}} =
\frac{s_{D}}{\sqrt{n}}
\label{eq:sDbar-dep}\end{equation} where $s_{D}$ is the sample standard deviation of
$D$, i.e. \begin{equation}s_{D} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (D_{i}-\overline{D})^{2}}{n-1}}.
\label{eq:s2D-dep}\end{equation} A test statistic for the null hypothesis
$H_{0}: \Delta=0$ is given by \begin{equation}t=
\frac{\hat{\Delta}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}}=
\frac{\overline{D}}{s_{D}/\sqrt{n}}
\label{eq:zD-dep}\end{equation} and its $P$-value is obtained either from the standard
normal distribution or the $t_{n-1}$ distribution. A confidence interval
for $\Delta$ with confidence level $1-\alpha$ is given by
\begin{equation}\hat{\Delta} \pm q_{\alpha/2} \times \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}
=\overline{D} \pm q_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{s_{D}}{\sqrt{n}}
\label{eq:ciD-dep}\end{equation} where the multiplier $q_{\alpha/2}$ is either
$z_{\alpha/2}$ or $t_{\alpha/2}^{(n-1)}$. These formulas are obtained by
noting that this is simply a one-sample analysis with the differences
$D$ in place of the variable $Y$, and applying the formulas of Section
\@ref(s-means-1sample) to the observed values of $D$.

  :(\#tab:t-2tests-dep)Results of tests and confidence intervals for comparing means of two
  dependent samples. For Example 7.4, the difference is between after
  and before the birth of the child, and for Example 7.5 it is between
  Friday the 13th and the preceding Friday the 6th. See the text for the
  definitions of the statistics. (* Obtained from the $t_{9}$ distribution;
  $\dagger$ Obtained from the standard normal distribution.)

Results for Examples 7.4 and 7.5 are shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-2tests-dep).
To illustrate the calculations, consider Example 7.5. The $n=10$ values
of $D_{i}$ for it are shown in Table \@ref(tab:t-F13), and the summary
statistics $\overline{D}=-1835$ and $s_{D}=1176$ in Table
\@ref(tab:t-groupex). The standard error of $\overline{D}$ is thus
$s_{D}/\sqrt{n}=1176/\sqrt{10}=372$ and the value of the test statistic
(\@ref(eq:zD-dep)) is
$$z=\frac{-1835}{1176/\sqrt{10}}=\frac{-1835}{372}=-4.93.$$ This example
differs from others we have considered so far in that the sample size of
$n=10$ is clearly too small for us to rely on large-sample results. It
is thus not appropriate to refer the test statistic to a standard normal
distribution. Instead, $P$-values can be obtained from a $t$
distribution, but only if the population distribution of $D$ itself can
be assumed to be approximately normal. Here we have only the ten
observed values of $D$ to use for a rather informal assessment of
whether this assumption appears to be reasonable. One value of $D$ is
smaller than -4000, and 2, 5, 2 of them are in the ranges -3000 to
-2001, -2000 to -1001, and -1000 to -1 respectively. Apart from the
smallest observation, the sample distribution of $D$ is thus at least
approximately symmetric. While this definitely does not prove that $D$
is normally distributed, it is at least not obviously inconsistent with
such a claim. We thus feel moderately confident that we can apply here
tests and confidence intervals based on the $t$ distribution.

The $P$-value, obtained from a $t$ distribution with $n-1=9$ degrees of
freedom, for the test statistic $-4.93$ is approximately 0.001. Even
with only ten pairs of observations, there is significant evidence that
the volume of traffic on a Friday the 13th differs from that of the
preceding Friday. A confidence interval for the difference is obtained
from (\@ref(eq:ciD-dep)) as $$-1835 \pm 2.26 \times 372 = (-2676; -994)$$
where the multiplier 2.26 is the quantity
$t_{\alpha/2}^{(n-1)}=t_{0.975}^{(9)}$, obtained from a computer or a
table of the $t_{9}$-distribution. The interval shows that we are 95%
confident that the average reduction in traffic on Friday the 13th on
the stretches of motorway considered here is between 994 and 2676
vehicles. This seems like a substantial systematic difference, although
not particularly large as a proportion of the total volume of traffic on
those roads. In the absence of other information we are tempted to
associate the reduction with some people avoiding driving on a day they
consider to be unlucky.

In Example 7.4 the $P$-value is 0.75, so we cannot reject the null
hypothesis that $\Delta=0$. There is thus no evidence that there was a
difference in first-time fathers’ self-assessed level of well-being
between the time their wives were six months pregnant, and a month after
the birth of the baby. This is also indicated by the 95% confidence
interval \mbox{($-0.40$; 0.56)} for the difference, which clearly covers
the value 0 of no difference.

## Further comments on significance tests {#s-means-tests3}

Some further aspects of significance testing are dicussed here. These
are not practical issues that need to be actively considered every time
you carry out a test. Instead, they provide context and motivation for
the principles behind significance tests.

### Different types of error {#ss-means-tests3-errors}

Consider for the moment the approach to significance testing where the
outcome is presented in the form of a discrete claim or decision about
the hypotheses, stating that the null hypothesis was either rejected or
not rejected. This claim can either be correct or incorrect, depending
on whether the null hypothesis is true in the population. There are four
possibilities, summarized in Table \@ref(tab:t-twoerrors). Two of these are
correct decisions and two are incorrect. The two kinds of incorrect
decisions are traditionally called

-   **Type I error:** rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true

-   **Type II error:** not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is
    false

The terms are unmemorably bland, but they do at least suggest an order
of importance. Type I error is conventionally considered more serious
than Type II, so what we most want to avoid is rejecting the null
hypothesis unnecessarily. This implies that we will maintain the null
hypothesis unless data provide strong enough evidence to justify
rejecting it, a principle which is somewhat analogous to the “keep a
theory until falsified” thinking of Popperian philosophy of science, or
even the “innocent until proven guilty” principle of jurisprudence.

  ------------ ------- ---------------------------------- ------------------

  :(\#tab:t-twoerrors)The four possible combinations of the truth of a null hypothesis
  $H_{0}$ in a population and decision about it from a significance
  test.

Dispite our dislike of Type I errors, we will not try to avoid them
completely. The only way to guarantee that the null hypothesis is never
incorrectly rejected is never to reject it at all, whatever the
evidence. This is not a useful decision rule for empirical research.
Instead, we will decide in advance how high a probability of Type I
error we are willing to tolerate, and then use a test procedure with
that probability. Suppose that we use a 5% level of significance to make
decisions from a test. The null hypothesis is then rejected if the
sample yields a test statistic for which the $P$-value is less than
0.05. If the null hypothesis is actually true, such values are, by the
definition of the $P$-value, obtained with probability 0.05. Thus the
significance level ($\alpha$-level) of a test is the probability of
making a Type I error. If we use a large $\alpha$-level (say
$\alpha=0.10$), the null hypothesis is rejected relatively easily
(whenever $P$-value is less than 0.10), but the chances of committing a
Type I error are correspondingly high (also 0.10); with a smaller value
like $\alpha=0.01$, the error probability is lower because $H_{0}$ is
rejected only when evidence against it is quite strong.

This description assumes that the true probability of Type I error for a
test *is* equal to its stated $\alpha$-level. This is true when the
assumptions of the test (about the population distribution, sample size
etc.) are satisfied. If the assumptions fail, the true significance
level will differ from the stated one, i.e. the $P$-value calculated
from the standard sampling distribution for that particular test will
differ from the true $P$-value which would be obtained from the exact
sampling distribution from the population in question. Sometimes the
difference is minor and can be ignored for most practical purposes (the
test is then said to be *robust* to violations of some of its
assumptions). In many situations, however, using an inappropriate test
may lead to incorrect conclusions: for example, a test which claims that
the $P$-value is 0.02 when it is really 0.35 will clearly give a
misleading picture of the strength of evidence against the null
hypothesis. To avoid this, the task of statisticians is to develop valid
(and preferably robust) tests for many different kinds of hypotheses and
data. The task of the empirical researcher is to choose a test which is
appropriate for his or her data.

In the spirit of regarding Type I errors as the most serious, the worst
kind of incorrect test is one which gives too low a $P$-value,
i.e. exaggerates the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.
Sometimes it is known that this is impossible or unlikely, so that the
$P$-value is either correct or too high. The significance test is then
said to be *conservative*, because its true rate of Type I errors will
be the same or lower than the stated $\alpha$-level. A conservative
procedure of statistical inference is regarded as the next best thing to
one which has the correct level of significance. For example, when the
sample size is relatively large, $P$-values for all of the tests
discussed in this chapter may be calculated from a standard normal or
from a $t$ distribution. $P$-values from a $t$ distribution are then
always somewhat larger. This means that using the $t$ distribution is
(very slightly) conservative when the population distributions are not
normal, so that we can safely use the $P$-values from SPSS output of a
$t$-test even in that case (this argument does not, however, justify
using the $t$-test when $Y$ is not normally distributed and the sample
size is small, because the sampling distribution of the $t$-test
statistic may then be very far from normal).

### Power of significance tests {#ss-means-tests3-power}

After addressing the question of Type I error by selecting an
appropriate test and deciding on the significance level to be used, we
turn our attention to Type II errors. The probability that a
significance test will reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact not
true, i.e. the probability of *avoiding* a Type II error, is known as
the **power** of the test. It depends, in particular, on

-   The nature of the test. If several valid tests are available for a
    particular analysis, we would naturally prefer one which tends to
    have the highest power. One aim of theoretical statistics is to
    identify the most powerful test procedures for different problems.

-   The sample size: other things being equal, larger samples mean
    higher power.

-   The true value of the population parameter to be tested, here the
    population mean or proportion. The power of any test will be highest
    when the true value is very different from the value specified by
    the null hypothesis. For example, it will obviously be easier to
    detect that a population mean differs from a null value of
    $\mu_{0}=5$ when the true mean is 25 than when it is 5.1.

-   The population variability of the variable. Since large population
    variance translates into large sampling variability and hence high
    levels of uncertainty, the power will be low when population
    variability is large, and high if the population variability is low.

The last three of these considerations are often used at the design
stage of a study to get an idea of the sample size required for a
certain level of power, or of the power achievable with a given sample
size. Since data collection costs time and money, we would not want to
collect a much larger sample than is required for a level of certainty
sufficient for the purposes of a study. On the other hand, if a
preliminary calculation reveals that the largest sample we can afford
would still be unlikely to give enough information to detect interesting
effects, the study might be best abandoned.

A power calculation requires the researcher to specify the kinds of
differences from a null hypothesis which are large enough to be of
practical or theoretical interest, so that she or he would want to be
able to detect them with high probability (it must always be accepted
that the power will be lower for smaller differences). For example,
suppose that we are planning a study to compare the effects of two
alternative teaching methods on the performance of students in an
examination where possible scores are between 0 and 100. The null
hypothesis is that average results are the same for students taught with
each method. It is decided that we want enough data to be able to reject
this with high probability if the true difference $\Delta$ of the
average exam scores between the two groups is larger than 5 points,
i.e. $\Delta<-5$ or $\Delta>5$. The power calculation might then answer
questions like

-   What is the smallest sample size for which the probability of
    rejecting $H_{0}: \Delta=0$ is at least 0.9, when the true value of
    $\Delta$ is smaller than $-5$ or larger than 5?

-   The largest sample sizes we can afford are 1000 in both groups,
    i.e. $n_{1}=n_{2}=1000$. What is the probability this gives us of
    rejecting $H_{0}: \Delta=0$ when the true value of $\Delta$ is
    smaller than $-5$ or larger than 5?

To answer these questions, we would also need a rough guess of the
population standard deviations $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$, perhaps
obtained from previous studies. Such calculations employ further
mathematical results for test statistics, essentially using their
sampling distributions under specific alternative hypotheses. The
details are, however, beyond the scope of this course.

### Significance vs. importance {#ss-means-tests3-importance}

The $P$-value is a measure of the strength of evidence the data provide
against the null hypothesis. This is not the same as the magnitude of
the difference between sample estimates and the null hypothesis, or the
practical importance of such differences. As noted above, the power of a
test increases with increasing sampling size. One implication of this is
that when $n$ is large, even quite small observed deviations from the
values that correspond exactly to the null hypothesis will be judged to
be statistically significant. Consider, for example, the two dietary
variables in Table \@ref(tab:t-ttests1). The
sample mean of the fat variable is 35.3, which is significantly
different (at the 5% level of significance) from $\mu_{0}$ of 35. It is
possible, however, that a difference of 0.3 might be considered
unimportant in practice. In contrast, the sample mean of the fruit and
vegetable variable is 2.8, and the difference from $\mu_{0}$ of 5 seems
not only strongly significant but also large for most practical
purposes.

In contrast to the large-sample case, in small samples even quite large
apparent deviations from the null hypothesis might still result in a
large $P$-value. For example, in a very small study a sample mean of the
fat variable of, say, 30 or even 50 might not be interpreted as
sufficiently strong evidence against a population mean of 35. This is
obviously related to the discussion of statistical power in the previous
section, in that it illustrates what happens when the sample is too
small to provide enough information for useful conclusions.

In these and all other cases, decisions about what is or is not of
practical importance are subject-matter questions rather than
statistical ones, and would have to be based on information about the
nature and implications of the variables in question. In our dietary
examples this would involve at least medical considerations, and perhaps
also financial implications of the public health costs of the observed
situation or of possible efforts of trying to change it.
